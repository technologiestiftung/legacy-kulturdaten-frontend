  "summary": "The code defines a reusable Accordion component that can be used to display collapsible content. The Accordion component is composed of two sub-components: AccordionItem and Accordion. \n\nThe AccordionItem component takes in a title and content as props, and renders a collapsible item with the title as the header and the content as the body. The header contains a button that toggles the visibility of the content. The component uses the useCollapsable hook to manage the state of the collapsible content. \n\nThe Accordion component takes in an array of AccordionItemProps as props, and renders a list of AccordionItems. The component can be used to display a list of collapsible items. \n\nThe code uses Emotion to style the components. The AccordionItem component is styled using CSS grid to create a two-column layout with the title on the left and the button on the right. The Accordion component is styled using flexbox to create a vertical list of AccordionItems. \n\nHere is an example of how the Accordion component can be used:\n\n```\nimport { Accordion } from './components/accordion';\n\nconst items = [\n  {\n    title: 'Item 1',\n    content: 'Content for item 1',\n  },\n  {\n    title: 'Item 2',\n    content: 'Content for item 2',\n  },\n  {\n    title: 'Item 3',\n    content: 'Content for item 3',\n  },\n];\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Accordion items={items} initiallyCollapsed={true} />\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, an Accordion component is rendered with an array of three AccordionItems. The initiallyCollapsed prop is set to true, which means that all the items will be collapsed by default.",
