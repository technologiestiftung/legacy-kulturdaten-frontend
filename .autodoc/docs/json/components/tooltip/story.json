  "summary": "The code defines two stories for the Tooltip component using Storybook. The Tooltip component is imported from the current directory, while TooltipP is imported from the TooltipContent file in the same directory. \n\nThe first story, TooltipStory, renders a series of StyledTestContentBox components wrapped in a StyledTestContent component, followed by a StyledH2 component that contains a Tooltip component. The Tooltip component takes two TooltipP components as children, which are displayed when the user hovers over the StyledH2 component. \n\nThe second story, TooltipWrapperStory, is similar to the first, but includes a ScrollWrapper component that wraps the StyledTestContent and StyledH2 components. The Tooltip component in this story takes a parentNodeRef prop that references the ScrollWrapper component, allowing the Tooltip to be displayed within the scrolling area. \n\nOverall, these stories demonstrate how the Tooltip component can be used in different contexts within the larger project. The Tooltip component can be used to provide additional information or context to users when they hover over certain elements, and can be customized with different content and styling. The ScrollWrapper component and parentNodeRef prop show how the Tooltip can be used within scrolling areas, which may be useful for displaying tooltips on long pages or within modal windows.",
