  "summary": "The code defines a reusable `DropdownMenu` component that can be used to create dropdown menus with customizable buttons and content. The component is built using styled components and the emotion library.\n\nThe `DropdownMenu` component takes in several props, including `children` (the content of the dropdown menu), `icon` (the icon to display on the button), `text` (the text to display on the button), `form` (the shape of the button), `stretch` (whether the button should stretch to fill its container), `buttonColor` (the color of the button), `buttonSize` (the size of the button), `direction` (the direction in which the dropdown menu should open), and `menuWidth` (the width of the dropdown menu).\n\nThe `DropdownMenu` component renders a button that, when clicked, displays the dropdown menu. The button is styled using the `StyledDropdownMenuButton` component, which takes in several props to customize its appearance. The button's text and icon are also styled using the `StyledDropdownMenuButtonText` and `StyledDropdownMenuButtonIcon` components, respectively.\n\nThe dropdown menu itself is rendered using the `StyledDropdownMenuDropdown` component, which takes in several props to customize its appearance and behavior. The content of the dropdown menu is rendered using the `StyledDropdownMenuDropdownContent` component.\n\nThe `DropdownMenu` component also includes several utility enums (`DropdownMenuButtonColor`, `DropdownMenuForm`, `DropdownMenuDirection`, and `DropdownMenuButtonSize`) and a `DropdownMenuText` styled component that can be used to style the text content of the dropdown menu.\n\nOverall, the `DropdownMenu` component provides a flexible and customizable way to create dropdown menus in a React application.",
