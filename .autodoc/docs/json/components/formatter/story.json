  "summary": "The code above is a React component that renders a storybook story for a JSON formatter. The purpose of this component is to provide a visual representation of how JSON data will be formatted when passed through the Formatter component. \n\nThe component imports the necessary dependencies, including styled components and the Formatter component. It then defines a styled wrapper component that will be used to display the formatted JSON data. The wrapper component is defined using the styled() function from the styled components library. It takes two optional props, background and color, which can be used to set the background color and text color of the wrapper component. \n\nThe CodeFormatStory component is a storybook story that renders the Formatter component inside the StyledTestWrapper component. The Formatter component takes a single prop, content, which is an object containing the JSON data to be formatted. In this case, the content prop is set to an example object with three properties, a, b, and c. The c property is itself an object with three properties, x, y, and z. \n\nThe purpose of this component is to provide a visual representation of how JSON data will be formatted when passed through the Formatter component. This can be useful for developers who are working with JSON data and need to ensure that it is being formatted correctly. The component can be used in the larger project as a tool for testing and debugging JSON data. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { CodeFormatStory } from './CodeFormatStory';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>My Component</h1>\n      <CodeFormatStory />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```\n\nIn the example above, the CodeFormatStory component is rendered inside a parent component called MyComponent. This allows developers to see how their JSON data will be formatted within the context of their larger application.",
