  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `FormListField` that renders a form field with a label and an input component of a specified type. The component is used to create a list of form fields, where each field can be of a different type. The supported field types are defined in an enum called `FormListFieldType`, which includes `input`, `textarea`, `select`, `radioList`, `checkboxList`, and `tags`.\n\nThe `FormListField` component takes the following props:\n\n- `label`: a string that represents the label of the form field.\n- `type`: a value of the `FormListFieldType` enum that specifies the type of the input component to be rendered.\n- `fieldProps`: an object that contains the props to be passed to the input component.\n- `last`: a boolean that indicates whether the field is the last one in the list.\n- `first`: a boolean that indicates whether the field is the first one in the list.\n- `tooltip`: an optional object that contains the content of a tooltip to be displayed next to the label.\n\nThe component renders a `StyledFormListField` container that has a `StyledFormListFieldLabel` child that displays the label and an optional tooltip. The `StyledFormListField` container also has a `StyledFormListFieldField` child that renders the input component of the specified type. The input component is created dynamically based on the `type` prop using a mapping object called `formListFieldTypeComponentMap`. The mapping object maps each `FormListFieldType` value to an object that contains the input component and its variant.\n\nThe `FormListField` component uses the `usePseudoUID` hook to generate a unique ID for the input component. The `StyledFormListField` container has a `last` prop that determines whether a border is displayed at the bottom of the container. The `StyledFormListFieldField` container has `last` and `first` props that determine the border radius of the container.\n\nOverall, the `FormListField` component provides a flexible way to create a list of form fields with different input types and labels. It can be used in the larger project to create forms that require dynamic input fields.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `FormListField` component?\n- The `FormListField` component is used to render a form field with a label and various input types such as input, textarea, select, radioList, checkboxList, and tags.\n\n2. What is the `formListFieldTypeComponentMap` object used for?\n- The `formListFieldTypeComponentMap` object is used to map each `FormListFieldType` to its corresponding component and variant.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Tooltip` component used in `FormListField`?\n- The `Tooltip` component is used to display a tooltip with additional information about the form field, if provided in the `tooltip` prop."
