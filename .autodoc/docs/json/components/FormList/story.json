  "summary": "The code defines a set of React components for rendering forms with various input types. The components are used to create a form list, which is a group of fields that can be dynamically added or removed from the form. \n\nThe `FormListConditional` component is used to conditionally render a group of fields based on whether a checkbox is checked or not. The `FormListField` component is used to render individual form fields, such as text inputs, select boxes, radio buttons, and checkboxes. The `FormListGroup` component is used to group related fields together and display them with a title.\n\nThe `StyledTestWrapper` component is a styled wrapper that is used to apply custom styles to the form fields. It is defined using the `styled` function from the `@emotion/styled` package.\n\nThe `EmbeddedFormListDefaultStory` component is a functional component that renders a default set of form fields. It uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the form fields, such as the selected radio button value and the checked checkboxes. The `FormListDefaultStory` component is a Storybook story that renders the `EmbeddedFormListDefaultStory` component.\n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and reusable set of components for rendering forms with various input types. It can be used in the larger project to create forms for collecting data from users.",
