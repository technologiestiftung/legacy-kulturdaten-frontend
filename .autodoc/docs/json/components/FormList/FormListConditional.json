  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `FormListConditional` that renders a conditional list of items. The component takes in several props including a `label` string, a `checked` boolean, an `onChange` function, `children` as React nodes, an optional `id` string, and a `last` boolean. \n\nThe component renders a `StyledFormListConditional` div that has a `display` of `flex` and a `flex-direction` of `column`. The `last` prop is used to determine whether or not to add a `border-bottom` of `1px solid var(--grey-400)` to the div. The `checked` prop is used to determine whether or not to set the `background` of the div to `var(--grey-200)` or `var(--white)`.\n\nThe `StyledFormListConditionalLabel` div contains a `Checkbox` component that is used to toggle the `checked` prop. The `StyledFormListConditionalChevron` div contains a `ChevronDown` icon that is used to indicate whether or not the list is expanded. The `isOpen` prop is used to determine whether or not to rotate the chevron icon.\n\nThe `children` prop is an array of React nodes that are rendered conditionally based on the `checked` prop. If `checked` is `true`, the `children` are rendered inside a `StyledFormListConditionalChildren` div that contains a `StyledFormListConditionalChildrenContainer` div. The `children` are rendered as a list of `StyledFormListConditionalItem` divs. \n\nThe `last` prop is used to determine whether or not to add a `border-bottom` of `1px solid var(--grey-400)` to the last `StyledFormListConditionalItem` div.\n\nOverall, this component can be used to render a list of items that can be conditionally expanded or collapsed. It is useful for displaying hierarchical data or nested forms. The `Checkbox` component can be used to toggle the visibility of the nested items. The `ChevronDown` icon can be used to indicate whether or not the nested items are visible.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `FormListConditional` component?\n- The `FormListConditional` component is a React functional component that renders a conditional form list with a label, checkbox, and children.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `usePseudoUID` hook?\n- The `usePseudoUID` hook generates a unique ID for the `Checkbox` component if an ID is not provided as a prop.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `StyledFormListConditionalChevron` component?\n- The `StyledFormListConditionalChevron` component is a styled div that renders a chevron icon that rotates based on the `checked` prop of the `FormListConditional` component."
