  "summary": "The code above exports a React functional component called `CloudSvg`. This component returns an SVG element that represents a cloud icon. The SVG element has a width of 38 and a height of 28, and it has a viewBox of 0 0 38 38, which means that the SVG element is scalable and can be resized without losing its aspect ratio.\n\nThe cloud icon is drawn using a `path` element, which has a `d` attribute that defines the shape of the path. The `stroke` attribute sets the color of the path to the current color, which is defined by the `stroke` property of the SVG element. The `strokeWidth` property sets the width of the stroke to 2 pixels, and the `strokeLinecap` and `strokeLinejoin` properties set the style of the stroke to round.\n\nThe `CloudSvg` component can be used in other components or pages of the `kulturdaten-frontend` project to display a cloud icon. For example, it can be used in a file upload component to indicate that the file will be stored in the cloud. Here is an example of how the `CloudSvg` component can be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { CloudSvg } from './CloudSvg';\n\nconst FileUpload = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <CloudSvg />\n      <input type=\"file\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default FileUpload;\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `CloudSvg` component is imported from the `CloudSvg.tsx` file and rendered before an `input` element of type `file`. This will display the cloud icon next to the file upload button.",
  "questions": "1. What does this code do?\n- This code exports a React functional component called `CloudSvg` that renders an SVG image of a cloud with various paths and attributes.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `stroke` and `strokeWidth` attributes?\n- The `stroke` attribute sets the color of the stroke (outline) of the paths in the SVG, while the `strokeWidth` attribute sets the width of the stroke.\n\n3. Can this component be customized with props?\n- No, this component does not accept any props and will always render the same SVG image."
