  "summary": "The code above exports a React functional component called `CheckSvg`. This component renders an SVG image of a checkmark. The SVG image is defined using the SVG markup language and includes a path element that defines the shape of the checkmark.\n\nThe `CheckSvg` component takes no props and simply returns the SVG image. It is likely used in other components throughout the `kulturdaten-frontend` project to display a checkmark icon in various contexts.\n\nHere is an example of how the `CheckSvg` component might be used in another component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { CheckSvg } from './CheckSvg';\n\nconst MyComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Success!</h2>\n      <p>Your submission was successful.</p>\n      <CheckSvg />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the `CheckSvg` component is imported and rendered within the `MyComponent` component. The checkmark icon is displayed alongside a success message to indicate that the user's submission was successful.\n\nOverall, the `CheckSvg` component is a simple and reusable component that provides a consistent way to display a checkmark icon throughout the `kulturdaten-frontend` project.",
