  "summary": "The code above defines a React component called `AlertSymbol` that renders a red exclamation mark symbol inside a white circle. This symbol is commonly used to indicate an alert or warning message to the user. The component is styled using the `styled` function from the `@emotion/styled` library, which allows for CSS-in-JS styling. \n\nThe `AlertSymbol` component takes an optional `ariaLabel` prop, which is used to provide an accessible label for screen readers. If the `ariaLabel` prop is not provided, the component will use a default label obtained from the `useT` hook, which is a custom hook for internationalization. \n\nThe `ExclamationMarkSvg` component is imported from a separate file located in the `../assets` directory. This component renders an SVG image of an exclamation mark symbol. \n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to display alert or warning messages to the user. It can be imported and used in other React components like so:\n\n```\nimport { AlertSymbol } from './path/to/AlertSymbol';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <AlertSymbol ariaLabel=\"Warning\" />\n      <p>There was an error processing your request.</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `AlertSymbol` component is used to indicate a warning message to the user, followed by a descriptive message. The `ariaLabel` prop is provided to ensure accessibility for screen readers. \n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable and customizable component for displaying alert symbols in the project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `StyledAlertSymbol` component?\n- The `StyledAlertSymbol` component is used to style an alert symbol with a red background and an exclamation mark icon.\n\n2. What is the `AlertSymbol` component used for?\n- The `AlertSymbol` component is used to render the `StyledAlertSymbol` component with an optional `ariaLabel` prop that defaults to a translated string.\n\n3. What is the `useT` function imported from `lib/i18n` used for?\n- The `useT` function is used to access the translation function for the current language in order to translate the `ariaLabel` prop or the default string in the `AlertSymbol` component."
