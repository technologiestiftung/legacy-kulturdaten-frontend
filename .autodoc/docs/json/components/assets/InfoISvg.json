  "summary": "The code above exports a React functional component called `InfoISvg`. This component returns an SVG element that displays an \"i\" icon with two lines. The SVG element has a width and height of 36 and a viewBox of 0 0 36 36. The `fill` attribute is not set, so it defaults to \"none\". The `stroke` attribute is set to \"currentColor\", which means it will use the color of the parent element. The `strokeWidth` attribute is set to 2 for the main lines and 3 for the smaller lines. The `strokeLinecap` and `strokeLinejoin` attributes are set to \"round\" for both paths.\n\nThe first path element draws a vertical line from the center of the SVG element's height (18) to the top of the SVG element's height (24). The second path element draws a horizontal line from the center of the SVG element's width (18) to the right of the SVG element's width (18.0075).\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to display an \"i\" icon with two lines, typically used to indicate information or help. It can be imported and used in other React components like so:\n\n```\nimport { InfoISvg } from './path/to/InfoISvg';\n\nconst MyComponent: React.FC = () => (\n  <div>\n    <h2>Some Title <InfoISvg /></h2>\n    <p>Some text that needs an explanation.</p>\n  </div>\n);\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `InfoISvg` component is used inside an `h2` element to indicate that more information is available about the title. The `fill` attribute is not set, so the icon will inherit the color of the `h2` element's `color` property. The `stroke` attribute is set to \"currentColor\", so the icon will also inherit the `color` property. The `strokeWidth`, `strokeLinecap`, and `strokeLinejoin` attributes are set to their default values.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code exports a React functional component that renders an SVG icon.\n\n2. What does the SVG icon look like?\n   - The SVG icon is a 36x36 square with two paths: one vertical line from the center of the top to the center of the bottom, and one horizontal line from the center of the left to the center of the right.\n\n3. How can this SVG icon be customized?\n   - The SVG icon can be customized by changing the `stroke` color, `strokeWidth`, `strokeLinecap`, and `strokeLinejoin` properties. The `viewBox` property can also be adjusted to change the size and aspect ratio of the icon."
