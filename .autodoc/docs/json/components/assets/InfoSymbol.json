  "summary": "The code above defines a React component called `InfoSymbol` that renders an information icon. The icon is styled using the `StyledInfoSymbol` component from the `@emotion/styled` library. The icon is a blue circle with a white \"i\" in the center. The component takes an optional `ariaLabel` prop, which is used to provide an accessible label for the icon. If the `ariaLabel` prop is not provided, the component uses a default label obtained from the `useT` hook, which is used for internationalization.\n\nThis component is likely used in the larger project to provide a consistent and accessible way to display information icons throughout the user interface. By using a separate component for the icon, the project can ensure that the icon is styled consistently and that accessibility concerns are addressed. The `InfoSymbol` component can be used in other components by importing it and rendering it as a child component. For example:\n\n```\nimport { InfoSymbol } from './InfoSymbol';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>This is some text that needs an info icon <InfoSymbol /></p>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nOverall, this code demonstrates the use of styled components and the `useT` hook for internationalization in a React project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useT` function imported from `../../lib/i18n`?\n   - The `useT` function is used for internationalization and localization purposes.\n2. What is the significance of the `InfoISvg` component imported from `../assets/InfoISvg`?\n   - The `InfoISvg` component likely renders an SVG icon or image that represents information or help.\n3. What is the purpose of the `ariaLabel` prop in the `InfoSymbol` component?\n   - The `ariaLabel` prop is used to provide an accessible label for the `StyledInfoSymbol` div, which contains the `InfoISvg` component. If the prop is not provided, the label is retrieved from the translation file using the `useT` function."
