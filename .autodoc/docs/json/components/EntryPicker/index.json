  "summary": "The `EntryPicker` component is a reusable UI component that provides a dropdown list of entries for a specific category. It is used in the `kulturdaten-frontend` project to allow users to select an entry from a list of organizers, locations, or offers. \n\nThe component takes in several props, including `chooseText`, `editText`, `overlayTitle`, `value`, `list`, `categoryName`, `onChange`, `remove`, `showHint`, and `variant`. \n\nWhen the user clicks on the `StyledEntryPickerSlot` button, a dropdown list of entries is displayed in an overlay. The `list` prop is a React element that contains the list of entries to be displayed. When the user selects an entry from the list, the `onChange` function is called with the selected entry's ID as an argument. \n\nThe `EntryPicker` component also displays the currently selected entry, if there is one. If there is no selected entry, the `chooseText` prop is displayed. If there is a selected entry, the `editText` prop is displayed, along with the selected entry's name and address (if applicable). \n\nIf the `remove` prop is provided, a \"Remove\" button is displayed that calls the `onRemove` function when clicked. \n\nThe `EntryPicker` component uses several other components from the `kulturdaten-frontend` project, including `Button`, `OverlayContainer`, `OverlayTitleBar`, and `EntryListContextProvider`. \n\nOverall, the `EntryPicker` component provides a flexible and reusable way to display a dropdown list of entries for a specific category and allows users to select and edit entries as needed.",
