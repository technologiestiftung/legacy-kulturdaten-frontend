  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `ConfirmScreen` that renders a modal dialog box with a confirmation message and two buttons: one to confirm the action and another to cancel it. The component takes several props, including `title`, `message`, `visible`, `onConfirm`, `onCancel`, `confirmButtonText`, and `condition`. \n\nThe `visible` prop determines whether the modal is displayed or not. The `title` prop is used to set the title of the modal. The `message` prop is used to set the message displayed in the modal. The `onConfirm` prop is a callback function that is called when the user clicks the confirm button. The `onCancel` prop is a callback function that is called when the user clicks the cancel button. The `confirmButtonText` prop is used to set the text of the confirm button. The `condition` prop is an optional object that defines a condition that must be met before the user can confirm the action. \n\nThe `ConfirmScreen` component is styled using the `styled-components` library. The modal is positioned fixed at the top left of the screen and has a dark overlay to dim the background. The content of the modal is centered and has a white background. The title of the modal is displayed in a yellow bar at the top of the modal, along with an icon. The message is displayed below the title. If a condition is defined, an input field is displayed below the message that the user must fill in correctly before the confirm button is enabled. The confirm and cancel buttons are displayed at the bottom of the modal. \n\nThe `useConfirmScreen` hook is also defined in this file. It returns a function that takes several props and sets the state of the `ConfirmScreen` component accordingly. This hook is used to display the confirmation modal throughout the application. \n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable and customizable confirmation modal that can be used to confirm actions throughout the application.",
