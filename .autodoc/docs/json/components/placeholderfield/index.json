  "summary": "The code above defines a React component called `PlaceholderField` that renders a label and some text in a styled container. The component takes two props: `label` and `text`, both of which are strings.\n\nThe component is built using the `styled` function from the `@emotion/styled` library to create three styled components: `StyledPlaceholderField`, `StyledPlaceholderFieldLabel`, and `StyledPlaceholderFieldText`. These components define the styles for the container, label, and text, respectively. \n\nThe `PlaceholderField` component then renders these three styled components, along with the `Label` component from another file. The `Label` component is used to wrap the `label` prop, which adds additional styling to the label text.\n\nThis component can be used throughout the project to display placeholder text and labels in a consistent and styled manner. For example, it could be used in a form to display default values for input fields. \n\nHere is an example usage of the `PlaceholderField` component:\n\n```\n<PlaceholderField label=\"Name\" text=\"John Doe\" />\n```\n\nThis would render a container with the label \"Name\" and the text \"John Doe\" inside it, styled according to the styles defined in the component.",
