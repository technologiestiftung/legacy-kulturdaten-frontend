  "summary": "The `CheckboxList` component is a React functional component that renders a list of checkboxes. It takes in a set of props, including `label`, `id`, `checkboxes`, `value`, `required`, `onChange`, `columns`, and `variant`. \n\nThe `label` prop is a string that represents the label for the checkbox list. The `id` prop is a string that represents the ID of the checkbox list. The `checkboxes` prop is an array of objects that represent the individual checkboxes in the list. Each object has an `id`, `label`, and `value` property. The `value` prop is an array of strings that represent the values of the selected checkboxes. The `required` prop is a boolean that indicates whether the checkbox list is required. The `onChange` prop is a function that is called when the value of the checkbox list changes. The `columns` prop is a number that represents the number of columns in which the checkboxes should be displayed. The `variant` prop is a string that represents the variant of the checkbox list.\n\nThe component renders a `StyledCheckboxList` div that contains a `StyedCheckboxListLabel` div and a `StyledCheckboxListItems` ul. The `StyledCheckboxList` div is styled using CSS-in-JS with the `@emotion/styled` library. The `StyedCheckboxListLabel` div contains the label for the checkbox list. The `StyledCheckboxListItems` ul contains the individual checkboxes in the list. The number of columns in which the checkboxes are displayed is determined by the `columns` prop.\n\nThe component also renders a `StyledHiddenMultiSelect` select element that is used to store the selected values of the checkboxes. The `StyledHiddenMultiSelect` select element is hidden from view using CSS. The selected values of the checkboxes are stored in the `selectValue` state variable.\n\nThe `checkboxesToState` function is a helper function that takes in an array of checkbox objects and an array of selected values and returns an object that represents the state of the checkboxes. The `setCheckedState` function is a React state hook that sets the state of the checkboxes.\n\nThe `CheckboxList` component also uses the `useEffect` hook to update the state of the checkboxes when the `checkboxes` or `value` props change.\n\nThe `CheckboxList` component renders a `Checkbox` component for each checkbox in the `checkboxes` prop. The `Checkbox` component is a custom checkbox component that is imported from the `.` file. The `Checkbox` component takes in a set of props, including `id`, `label`, `inList`, `checked`, `onChange`, and `value`. The `id` prop is a string that represents the ID of the checkbox. The `label` prop is a string that represents the label for the checkbox. The `inList` prop is a boolean that indicates whether the checkbox is part of a list. The `checked` prop is a boolean that indicates whether the checkbox is checked. The `onChange` prop is a function that is called when the value of the checkbox changes. The `value` prop is a string that represents the value of the checkbox.\n\nWhen a checkbox is checked or unchecked, the `onChange` function is called. The `onChange` function updates the state of the checkboxes and the `selectValue` state variable. If the `onChange` prop is defined, it is called with the updated `selectValue` array. Otherwise, the `internalState` state variable is updated with the updated `selectValue` array.\n\nOverall, the `CheckboxList` component is a reusable component that can be used to render a list of checkboxes with customizable labels, values, and number of columns. It also provides a hidden select element that can be used to store the selected values of the checkboxes.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a React component called `CheckboxList` that renders a list of checkboxes with optional labels and columns.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code imports `styled` and `css` from `@emotion/styled`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useState` from `react`, and `Checkbox` from a local file. It also imports various types and constants from other local files.\n\n3. What props can be passed to the `CheckboxList` component?\n- The `CheckboxList` component accepts props for `label`, `id`, `checkboxes`, `value`, `required`, `onChange`, `columns`, and `variant`. The `checkboxes` prop is an array of objects with `id`, `label`, and `value` properties that define the individual checkboxes to be rendered. The `value` prop is an array of strings that represent the currently selected checkboxes. The `onChange` prop is a function that is called when the selection changes, and it receives an array of strings representing the newly selected checkboxes. The `columns` prop is an optional number that specifies the number of columns to use for the grid layout of the checkboxes. The `variant` prop is an optional string that specifies the variant of the component to be rendered."
