  "summary": "This code exports three stories for the Checkbox component and one story for the CheckboxList component using Storybook. Storybook is a tool for developing UI components in isolation, which allows developers to build and test components independently of the larger application. \n\nThe Checkbox component is imported from the current directory, while CheckboxList is imported from a subdirectory. The Checkbox component is a simple checkbox input with a label, while CheckboxList is a list of checkboxes with a label. \n\nThe `StyledTestWrapper` component is a styled div that is used to wrap the Checkbox and CheckboxList components in each story. It is defined using the `styled` function from the `@emotion/styled` package. The `StyledTestWrapper` component takes two optional props, `background` and `color`, which are used to set the background color and text color of the component. \n\nThe first story, `CheckboxDefaultStory`, renders a single Checkbox component with a label and an id of \"test1\". This story is named \"Default Checkbox\". \n\nThe second story, `CheckboxDisabledStory`, renders two Checkbox components with labels and ids of \"test1\" and \"test2\". The first Checkbox is unchecked and disabled, while the second Checkbox is checked and disabled. This story is named \"Disabled Checkbox\". \n\nThe third story, `CheckboxListStory`, renders a CheckboxList component with a label and an array of Checkbox objects. Each Checkbox object has an id, label, and value property, and some have a checked property. This story is named \"Checkbox List\". \n\nThese stories are used to visually test the Checkbox and CheckboxList components and ensure that they are working as expected. They can also be used as documentation for other developers who want to use these components in their own code.",
