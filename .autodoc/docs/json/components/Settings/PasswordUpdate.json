  "summary": "The `UserPasswordUpdate` component is a form that allows a user to update their password. It imports several components from the project's library, including `Button`, `Input`, `Info`, and `FormGrid`. It also imports several utility functions from the project's `lib` directory, including `useApiCall` and `userUpdateFactory`.\n\nThe component renders a form with three password fields: \"Old Password\", \"New Password\", and \"Confirm New Password\". When the form is submitted, the component sends a request to the server to update the user's password. If the request is successful, the component displays a success message. If the request fails, the component displays an error message.\n\nThe component uses several hooks to manage its state. The `useState` hook is used to manage the state of the password fields and the success flag. The `useMemo` hook is used to compute whether the \"New Password\" and \"Confirm New Password\" fields match. The `useEffect` hook is used to update the error messages when the \"New Password\" and \"Confirm New Password\" fields change.\n\nThe component also uses the `useApiCall` hook to send requests to the server. The `userUpdateFactory` function is used to create the request payload. If the request fails, the component parses the error message and displays a user-friendly error message.\n\nOverall, the `UserPasswordUpdate` component is an important part of the project's user management system. It allows users to securely update their passwords and provides helpful feedback if there are any errors.",
