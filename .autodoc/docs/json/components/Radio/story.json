  "summary": "The code above is a React component that renders a radio list. It imports the `styled` function from the `@emotion/styled` package, the `Story` component from the `@storybook/react` package, and the `useState` hook and the `RadioList` component from a local file called `RadioList.tsx`. \n\nThe component exports a `RadioListStory` component that is used to display the radio list in a Storybook story. The `RadioListStory` component uses the `useState` hook to manage the selected value of the radio list. It renders a `StyledTestWrapper` component that is styled using the `styled` function. The `StyledTestWrapper` component is a `div` element that has a grid layout with one column and a padding of 1.5rem. It also has two optional props: `background` and `color`, which can be used to set the background color and text color of the component.\n\nInside the `StyledTestWrapper` component, the `RadioList` component is rendered with some props. The `value` prop is set to the current selected value of the radio list, which is managed by the `useState` hook. The `onChange` prop is a callback function that is called when the selected value of the radio list changes. It updates the state of the `value` variable with the new selected value. The `id` and `name` props are used to set the `id` and `name` attributes of the radio list. Finally, the `options` prop is an array of objects that represent the radio list options. Each object has an `id`, a `label`, and a `value` property.\n\nThe `RadioListStory` component is given a `storyName` property of 'Radio List', which is used to display the name of the story in the Storybook UI.\n\nOverall, this code is a reusable component that can be used to render a radio list with customizable styles and options. It is used in the larger project to display a radio list of options for the user to select from.",
