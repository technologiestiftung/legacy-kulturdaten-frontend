  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `Radio` that renders a custom radio input element with a label. The component is styled using the `styled` function from the `@emotion/styled` library and the `css` function from the `@emotion/react` library.\n\nThe component takes several props, including `id`, `label`, `ariaLabel`, `onChange`, `checked`, `name`, `disabled`, `required`, `softRequired`, `valid`, and `value`. These props are used to configure the behavior and appearance of the radio input.\n\nThe component renders a container element (`StyledRadio`) that contains the radio input and label. The radio input is rendered using the `StyledRadioInput` component, which is a styled `input` element. The `StyledRadioInput` component takes several props, including `softRequired` and `valid`, which are used to apply styles to the input based on its validation state. The `StyledRadioInput` component also renders a checkmark icon (`StyledRadioInputCheck`) when the input is checked.\n\nThe label is rendered using the `StyledRadioLabel` component, which is a styled `label` element. The `StyledRadioLabel` component takes a `disabled` prop, which is used to apply styles to the label when the input is disabled.\n\nOverall, this component can be used to render custom radio inputs with labels that can be styled and configured using props. It can be used in forms or other contexts where radio inputs are needed. An example usage of the component might look like this:\n\n```\n<Radio\n  id=\"radio1\"\n  label=\"Option 1\"\n  checked={true}\n  onChange={(e) => console.log(e.target.value)}\n  value=\"option1\"\n/>\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Radio` component?\n- The `Radio` component is a React functional component that renders a radio input with a label and optional validation styles.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `StyledRadio` and `StyledRadioInput` components?\n- The `StyledRadio` and `StyledRadioInput` components are styled components that define the styles for the radio input and its container.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `softRequired` prop?\n- The `softRequired` prop is a boolean that indicates whether the radio input is required for form submission, but allows for a non-selected state. It is used to apply validation styles when the input is not selected."
