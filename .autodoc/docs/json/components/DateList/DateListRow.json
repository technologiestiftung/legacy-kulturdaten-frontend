  "summary": "The code above defines a React component called `DateListRow` that renders a row in a table of dates. The component takes several props, including `from`, `to`, `title`, `status`, `body`, `checked`, `onChange`, `editable`, and `disabled`. \n\nThe `DateListRow` component renders a table row (`<tr>`) with several cells (`<td>`) that display information about a date. The first cell contains a checkbox that allows the user to select the date. The second cell displays the start date of the event, and the third cell displays the end date of the event (if it exists). The fourth cell displays the title of the event. The fifth cell displays a status flag that indicates whether the event is confirmed, tentative, or cancelled. The sixth cell contains a button that toggles the display of additional information about the event.\n\nThe `DateListRow` component uses several styled components to define the appearance of the table cells. The `StyledDateListRowCell` component defines the appearance of each cell, including its width and background color. The `StyledDateListRow` component defines the appearance of the entire row, including its display style and border. The `StyledDateListItemCheckbox`, `StyledDateListItemText`, `StyledDateListItemStatus`, `StyledDateListItemExpand`, and `StyledDateListItemBody` components define the appearance of the checkbox, text, status flag, expand button, and collapsible content, respectively.\n\nThe `DateListRow` component uses several utility functions and hooks to format dates, generate unique IDs, and manage the state of the collapsible content. The `useDate` hook formats dates using the `DateFormat.dayDateTime` format. The `usePseudoUID` hook generates a unique ID for the checkbox. The `useCollapsable` hook manages the state of the collapsible content and returns a rendered version of the content that can be displayed or hidden based on the state of the expand button.\n\nOverall, the `DateListRow` component provides a reusable way to display information about dates in a table format. It allows users to select dates, view basic information about events, and toggle the display of additional information about events. The component can be used in conjunction with other components in the `kulturdaten-frontend` project to build more complex user interfaces for managing cultural events.",
