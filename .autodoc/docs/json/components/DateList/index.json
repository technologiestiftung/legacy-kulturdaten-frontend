  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `DateList` that renders a table of dates. The component takes in several props, including an array of dates, a boolean indicating whether the dates are editable, and functions to handle changes to the dates and to delete dates. \n\nThe component renders a table with a header row and a body containing one row for each date. The header row contains column titles for the date fields, including \"From\", \"To\", \"Title\", and \"Status\". The body rows contain the date information, including the start and end dates, the title of the event, and the status of the date. \n\nThe component also includes a checkbox for each date that allows the user to select multiple dates for deletion. The component also includes sorting functionality for the \"From\" and \"To\" columns, which can be activated by clicking on the column header. \n\nThe `useDateList` hook is also defined, which returns the `DateList` component along with functions to get and set the currently checked date IDs. \n\nOverall, this component is used to display and manage a list of dates for events in the larger project.",
