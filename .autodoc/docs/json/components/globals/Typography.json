  "summary": "The code above is responsible for defining the typography and font styles for the entire project. It imports the `Global` and `css` components from the `@emotion/react` library and exports two constants, `fontFamily` and `fontFamilyMono`. \n\nThe `Typography` component is a functional component that returns a `Global` component with a `styles` prop that contains CSS rules for defining the font faces and styles. The `@font-face` rule is used to define custom fonts for the project. The `font-family` property is set to the `fontFamily` and `fontFamilyMono` constants, which are defined at the top of the file. \n\nEach `@font-face` rule defines a font family, source, weight, display, and style. The `src` property specifies the location of the font files in the project directory. The `font-weight` property specifies the weight of the font, which can be either 500 or 700. The `font-display` property specifies how the font should be displayed, which is set to `auto` in this case. The `font-style` property specifies the style of the font, which can be either `normal` or `italic`. \n\nThe `html` rule sets the font family to `fontFamily`, which is defined at the top of the file. It also sets the font weight to a custom CSS variable `--font-weight-normal`, which is likely defined elsewhere in the project. Other CSS properties are also set to improve the legibility and rendering of the text. \n\nOverall, this code is responsible for defining the typography and font styles for the entire project. It can be used in conjunction with other components and styles to create a cohesive and consistent design system. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Typography } from './Typography';\n\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Typography />\n      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>\n      <p>This is some text.</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `Typography` component is imported and rendered at the top of the `App` component. This ensures that the font styles are applied to all text elements within the `App` component.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines font families and styles for the typography used in the project.\n\n2. What font families are being used in this code?\n   - The code defines two font families: IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Mono.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `font-display` property in the `@font-face` rules?\n   - The `font-display` property determines how the font is displayed while it is loading. In this code, the value `auto` is used, which means the browser will use its default behavior for font loading."
