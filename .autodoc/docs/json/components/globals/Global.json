  "summary": "The code above is a React functional component that exports a Global component. This component is responsible for setting global styles for the entire application. It uses the Emotion library to define CSS styles in a JavaScript file.\n\nThe Global component is a wrapper around the EmotionGlobal component from the Emotion library. It takes no props and simply defines the global styles for the application. The styles are defined using the css function from the Emotion library, which allows for CSS to be written in a JavaScript file.\n\nThe styles defined in this component set the color and background of the html and body elements to the values of the --black and --white CSS variables respectively. It also sets the width of these elements to 100% and applies a letter-spacing of -0.005em to all child elements.\n\nThis component is likely used in the larger project to ensure consistent styling across all components and pages. By defining global styles in a single component, it makes it easier to maintain and update the styling of the entire application. Other components can then be styled using CSS-in-JS techniques provided by the Emotion library.\n\nExample usage of this component in a React application:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Global } from './Global';\n\nconst App: React.FC = () => {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Global />\n      <div>Hello World</div>\n    </>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nIn the example above, the Global component is imported and used as a wrapper around the entire application. This ensures that the global styles defined in the component are applied to all elements in the application.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Global` component?\n   - The `Global` component is used to apply global styles to the entire application using Emotion's `Global` component.\n\n2. What is the `css` function from Emotion used for in this code?\n   - The `css` function is used to define the global styles for the `html` and `body` elements, as well as any child elements using the `*` selector.\n\n3. What variables are being used for the `color` and `background` properties?\n   - The `color` property is using the `--black` variable and the `background` property is using the `--white` variable, which are likely defined elsewhere in the application's CSS or theme files."
