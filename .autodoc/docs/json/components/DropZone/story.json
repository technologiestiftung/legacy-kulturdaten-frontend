  "summary": "The code above is a storybook story for the `DropZone` component of the `kulturdaten-frontend` project. Storybook is a tool for developing UI components in isolation and documenting them. The `DropZone` component is a UI element that allows users to drag and drop files onto it for uploading. \n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code import the necessary dependencies for the story, including the `Story` component from `@storybook/react`, the `styled` function from `@emotion/styled`, the `DropZone` component from the current directory (`.`), and the `useState` hook from `react`.\n\nThe `title` property of the `export default` object sets the title of the story in the Storybook UI.\n\nThe `StoryWrapper` constant is a styled `div` element that adds padding to the story.\n\nThe `DropZoneDefaultStory` constant is a storybook story that renders the `DropZone` component with default props. It uses the `useState` hook to set the `files` state to an empty array. The `DropZone` component is then rendered with an `onDrop` prop that sets the `files` state to the dropped files, a `label` prop that sets the text displayed in the `DropZone`, and an `acceptedFileTypes` prop that sets the accepted file types for the `DropZone`.\n\nThis story can be used to test and document the `DropZone` component in isolation, without having to navigate to the larger project. It allows developers to see how the component behaves with different props and file types, and can be used as a reference for implementing the `DropZone` component in other parts of the project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines a story for a Drop Zone component and sets up a default story with a label and accepted file types.\n\n2. What dependencies are being used in this code?\n   This code imports the Story component from '@storybook/react', the styled component from '@emotion/styled', the DropZone component from '.', and the useState hook from 'react'.\n\n3. What props are being passed to the DropZone component?\n   The DropZone component is being passed an onDrop function to handle dropped files, a label string to display above the drop zone, and an array of accepted file types with a single object containing a mimeType of 'image/svg+xml' and a name of 'SVG'."
