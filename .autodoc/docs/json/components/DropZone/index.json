  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `DropZone` that renders a drop zone for files. The component is styled using the `@emotion/styled` and `@emotion/react` libraries. The drop zone is a label element that is styled to look like a box with a dashed border. When a file is dragged over the drop zone, the border changes to a solid color and the box shadow changes to indicate whether the file is valid or not. If the file is valid, the box shadow is green, otherwise it is red. \n\nThe component accepts several props, including `label`, `onDrop`, `acceptedFileTypes`, `isUploading`, `progress`, `success`, `disabled`, `disabledMessage`, `max`, and `maxFileSizeInKb`. The `label` prop is the text that appears inside the drop zone. The `onDrop` prop is a callback function that is called when a file is dropped onto the drop zone. The `acceptedFileTypes` prop is an array of objects that specify the MIME types and human-readable names of the file types that are allowed to be dropped onto the zone. The `isUploading` prop is a boolean that indicates whether a file is currently being uploaded. The `progress` prop is a number between 0 and 1 that indicates the progress of the upload. The `success` prop is an object that contains a count of the number of files that have been successfully uploaded. The `disabled` prop is a boolean that indicates whether the drop zone is disabled. The `disabledMessage` prop is the text that appears inside the drop zone when it is disabled. The `max` prop is the maximum number of files that can be dropped onto the zone. The `maxFileSizeInKb` prop is the maximum file size in kilobytes that is allowed to be dropped onto the zone.\n\nThe component uses several state variables to keep track of the state of the drop zone. The `isDropOver` state variable is a boolean that indicates whether a file is currently being dragged over the drop zone. The `isValidFiles` state variable is a boolean that indicates whether the file being dragged over the drop zone is valid. The `fileSizeValid` state variable is a boolean that indicates whether the file size is valid. The `dropFileSize` state variable is a number that indicates the size of the file being dropped onto the zone. \n\nThe component also uses several hooks, including `useCallback`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, and `useState`. The `useCallback` hook is used to memoize the `wrappedOnDrop` function, which is called when a file is dropped onto the zone. The `useEffect` hook is used to add an event listener to the file input element that is used to select files to upload. The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the `pending` state variable, which is a boolean that indicates whether a file is currently being uploaded and the progress is 1. The `useRef` hook is used to create a reference to the file input element. The `useState` hook is used to create state variables for `isDropOver`, `isValidFiles`, `fileSizeValid`, and `dropFileSize`.\n\nOverall, the `DropZone` component provides a user-friendly way to upload files to the application. It allows users to drag and drop files onto the drop zone and provides feedback on whether the file is valid or not. It also provides information on the file types and file size restrictions.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a React component called `DropZone` that renders a drop zone for file uploads with various features such as file type and size restrictions, progress tracking, and success messages.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code imports several functions and components from external libraries such as `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`, and `react`.\n- This code also imports a custom hook called `useT` from a file located at `../../lib/i18n`.\n\n3. What props can be passed to the `DropZone` component and what do they do?\n- The `DropZone` component accepts several props such as `label`, `onDrop`, `acceptedFileTypes`, `isUploading`, `progress`, `success`, `disabled`, `disabledMessage`, `max`, and `maxFileSizeInKb`.\n- These props control various aspects of the drop zone such as the label text, file type and size restrictions, progress tracking, and success messages."
