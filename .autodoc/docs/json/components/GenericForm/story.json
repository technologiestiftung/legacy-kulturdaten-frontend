  "summary": "This code defines two stories for a generic form component in a React project called Kulturdaten Frontend. The purpose of the generic form is to provide a reusable form structure that can be used for different types of data entry. The stories demonstrate how the form can be used for two different types of data: location accessibility and test services.\n\nThe code imports several dependencies, including styled components, Storybook, and two configuration files for location accessibility and test services. It also imports a wrapper component for the entry form and a custom hook called `useGenericFormStructure`.\n\nThe `useGenericFormStructure` hook is used to generate the form structure based on the configuration file and any additional options passed as arguments. The hook returns an object with a `renderedForm` property, which is the generated form structure.\n\nThe code defines two React functional components, `EmbeddedGenericFormLocationStory` and `EmbeddedGenericFormServicesStory`, which use the `useGenericFormStructure` hook to generate the form structure for location accessibility and test services, respectively. The components wrap the generated form structure in a styled component called `StyledTestWrapper` and the `EntryFormWrapper` component.\n\nThe code also defines two Storybook stories, `GenericFormAccessibilityLocationStory` and `GenericFormServicesStory`, which render the `EmbeddedGenericFormLocationStory` and `EmbeddedGenericFormServicesStory` components, respectively. The stories are used to visually test the form component and demonstrate how it can be used in different contexts.\n\nOverall, this code demonstrates how the generic form component can be used to generate a reusable form structure for different types of data entry. The `useGenericFormStructure` hook is a key part of this functionality, as it generates the form structure based on a configuration file and any additional options passed as arguments. The Storybook stories provide a way to visually test the component and demonstrate its flexibility and reusability.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useGenericFormStructure` hook?\n   - The `useGenericFormStructure` hook is used to generate a form structure based on the provided configuration object.\n2. What is the significance of the `StyledTestWrapper` component?\n   - The `StyledTestWrapper` component is a styled component that defines the layout and styling of the form elements.\n3. What is the difference between the `GenericFormAccessibilityLocationStory` and `GenericFormServicesStory` components?\n   - The `GenericFormAccessibilityLocationStory` component generates a form structure based on the `locationAccessibility` configuration object, while the `GenericFormServicesStory` component generates a form structure based on the `testServices` configuration object."
