  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `Info` that renders an information box with an icon, a title, and some content. The component takes several props, including `children` (the content to be displayed), `color` (the color scheme of the box), `title` (an optional title to be displayed above the content), and `noMaxWidth` (an optional flag to disable the maximum width of the content).\n\nThe component is styled using Emotion, a CSS-in-JS library. The `StyledInfo` component defines the overall style of the information box, including its border radius, font size, padding, and background color. The `StyledInfoIcon` component defines the style of the icon, which is a `react-feather` component called `Info`. The `StyledInfoContent` component defines the style of the content container, which is a flexbox with a column direction and a gap between rows. The `StyledInfoText` component defines the style of the title and content text, which are also flexboxes with a column direction and a gap between rows. Finally, the `InfoUl`, `InfoLi`, and `InfoP` components define the styles of unordered lists, list items, and paragraphs that can be used within the content of the information box.\n\nThe `InfoColor` enum defines several color schemes that can be used for the information box, including yellow, grey, white, and green. The `infoColorMap` object maps each color scheme to its corresponding background color, text color, and border color.\n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable and customizable component for displaying information boxes with consistent styling throughout the project. It can be used in various contexts, such as displaying help text, error messages, or notifications. The `Info` component can be imported and used in other React components like this:\n\n```\nimport { Info, InfoColor } from './path/to/Info';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Info color={InfoColor.green} title=\"Title\">\n        <InfoP>Content</InfoP>\n        <InfoUl>\n          <InfoLi>List item 1</InfoLi>\n          <InfoLi>List item 2</InfoLi>\n        </InfoUl>\n      </Info>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Info` component?\n   - The `Info` component is a styled component that displays information with an icon and customizable colors.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `InfoColor` enum and `infoColorMap` object?\n   - The `InfoColor` enum defines the available color options for the `Info` component, and the `infoColorMap` object maps each color option to its corresponding background, text, and border colors.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `insetBorderColored` function and how is it used?\n   - The `insetBorderColored` function is a helper function that generates a CSS box-shadow property with an inset border and a specified color. It is used in the `StyledInfo` component to create a colored border around the component."
