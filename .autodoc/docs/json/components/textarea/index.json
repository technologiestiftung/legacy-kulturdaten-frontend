  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `Textarea` that renders a textarea input field with a label, tooltip, and character count. The component takes in various props such as `id`, `value`, `onChange`, `label`, `tooltip`, `maxLength`, and `debounce`. \n\nThe `StyledTextareaContainer` and `StyledTextarea` components are defined using the `styled` function from the `@emotion/styled` library. The `StyledTextareaContainer` component is a container for the `StyledLabel` component and the `StyledTextarea` component. The `StyledTextarea` component is a styled textarea element that inherits styles from the `inputStyles` function defined in the `../input` file. \n\nThe `Textarea` component uses the `useT` hook from the `../../lib/i18n` file to get the translation function `t` for translating text. It also uses the `useState` hook to manage the `pristine`, `touched`, `internalState`, and `count` states. The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `internalState` and `count` states when the `props.value` changes. The `useDebounce` hook is used to debounce the `onChange` event if the `debounce` prop is set to `true`.\n\nThe `countAlertCall` function is used to call the `speakerFunction` from the `../pages/helpers/useSpeaker` file to speak the number of characters left when the user types in the textarea. The `speakerFunction` is a text-to-speech function that reads out the text passed to it.\n\nThe `Textarea` component renders the `Label` component with the `StyledTooltip` component if the `tooltip` prop is set. The `StyledTooltip` component renders the `Tooltip` component with the `TooltipP` component as its child if the `tooltip` prop is a string, or the `tooltip` prop itself if it is a React node. The `StyledTextarea` component renders the textarea element with the `props` passed to it, and the `StyledCharacterCount` component if the `maxLength` prop is set. The `StyledCharacterCount` component displays the character count and the maximum character limit.\n\nOverall, the `Textarea` component provides a customizable textarea input field with additional features such as a label, tooltip, and character count. It can be used in forms or other parts of the project that require user input.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Textarea` component?\n- The `Textarea` component is a React functional component that renders a textarea input field with various props for customization.\n\n2. What is the `useDebounce` hook used for?\n- The `useDebounce` hook is used to delay the execution of a function until a certain amount of time has passed without the function being called again. In this code, it is used to delay the execution of the `onChange` function until the user has stopped typing for a certain amount of time.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `countAlertCall` function?\n- The `countAlertCall` function is used to generate an alert message that is read aloud by a text-to-speech function when the user is approaching the maximum character limit for the textarea input field. The message informs the user how many characters they have left before reaching the limit."
