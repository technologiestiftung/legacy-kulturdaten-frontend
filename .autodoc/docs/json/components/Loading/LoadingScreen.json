  "summary": "The code defines a loading screen component and a hook that can be used to display the loading screen with a message and/or error while an asynchronous operation is being performed. \n\nThe `StyledLoadingScreen` component is a styled div that is fixed to the top left corner of the screen and has a black background with 85% opacity. It has a transition effect that slides it in or out of view depending on the `direction` prop, which is an enum with two possible values: `in` or `out`. The `visible` prop determines whether the component is displayed or not. The component contains a `StyledLoadingScreenContent` component that displays the loading message, error message, or checkmark icon depending on the state of the loading operation. \n\nThe `StyledLoadingScreenContent` component is a styled div that contains the loading message, error message, or checkmark icon. It has a transition effect that slides it in or out of view depending on the `direction` prop. The `visible` prop determines whether the component is displayed or not. \n\nThe `StyledLoadingScreenWobbler` component is a styled div that displays a loading animation. It has an optional `invert` prop that changes the color of the animation. \n\nThe `LoadingScreen` component is a functional component that takes in a `title`, `visible`, `loading`, `message`, and `error` prop. It renders the `StyledLoadingScreen` and `StyledLoadingScreenContent` components with the appropriate props based on the state of the loading operation. \n\nThe `useLoadingScreen` hook returns a function that takes in a `title`, `load` function, `message`, `preDelayInMs`, and `postDelayInMs` props. When called, it sets the loading screen state to display the loading message, calls the `load` function, and then sets the loading screen state to display the checkmark icon or error message depending on the result of the `load` function. The `preDelayInMs` and `postDelayInMs` props are optional delays that can be used to control the timing of the loading screen display. \n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable loading screen component and hook that can be used throughout the project to display loading messages and errors during asynchronous operations.",
