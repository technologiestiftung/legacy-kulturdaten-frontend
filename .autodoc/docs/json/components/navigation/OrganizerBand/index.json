  "summary": "The code defines the `OrganizerBand` component, which is a navigation bar that displays a list of organizers. The component is used in the larger project to allow users to switch between different organizers and to create new organizers. \n\nThe component imports several hooks and functions from other files in the project. These include `useLanguage` and `useLocale` from `routing.ts`, `getTranslation` from `translations.ts`, and `routes` from `routes.ts`. The component also imports several other components, including `OrganizerBandItem`, `StandardLink`, and `SkipLinkMainContent`.\n\nThe `OrganizerBand` component takes a `layout` prop, which determines the layout of the navigation bar. The component then uses several hooks to get information about the current user and the current router state. For example, it uses `useOrganizerId` to get the ID of the currently active organizer, and `useUserOrganizerLists` to get a list of organizers that the user owns or contributes to.\n\nThe component then renders a list of `OrganizerBandItem` components, one for each organizer in the user's list. Each `OrganizerBandItem` component displays the name and logo of the organizer, and allows the user to switch to that organizer by clicking on the item. The component also includes a \"Create Organizer\" button that allows the user to create a new organizer.\n\nIf the user is in \"admin mode\", the component displays an additional item that allows the user to leave admin mode. The component also includes a \"Skip to main content\" button that allows users to skip the navigation bar and go directly to the main content of the page.\n\nOverall, the `OrganizerBand` component is an important part of the larger project's navigation system. It allows users to switch between different organizers and to create new organizers, and it provides a consistent user interface for these actions.",
