  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `TitleBar` that renders a title bar with an optional action button. The component takes in several props including `title`, `action`, `secondary`, `secondaryPresent`, and `reversed`. \n\nThe `StyledTitleBar` component is a styled div that sets the background color and box shadow of the title bar. The `StyledTitleBarContainer` component is a styled div that sets the layout of the title bar container. It is a flex container with space between the items and can be reversed if the `reversed` prop is set to true. \n\nThe `StyledTitle` component is a styled h1 tag that sets the font size, line height, font weight, and padding of the title. It also sets the order and text alignment of the title based on the `reversed` and `hasAction` props. If the `skeleton` prop is set to true, it renders a placeholder title with a grey background. \n\nThe `StyledAction` component is a styled div that sets the height and margin of the action button container. \n\nThe `TitleBar` component renders the `StyledTitleBar` and `StyledTitleBarContainer` components with the `title` and `action` props. If the `action` prop is defined, it renders the `StyledAction` component with the `action` prop. \n\nThe `secondary` and `secondaryPresent` props are used to determine the background color and box shadow of the title bar based on the breakpoint. The `reversed` prop is used to determine the layout of the title bar container. \n\nThis component can be used in the larger project as a reusable title bar component with an optional action button. It can be customized with different background colors, box shadows, and layouts based on the props passed in. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n<TitleBar title=\"My Title\" action={<Button>Click Me</Button>} secondary={true} reversed={true} />\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `TitleBar` component?\n- The `TitleBar` component is used to display a title and an optional action element, with customizable styling options such as a secondary background color and reversed layout.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `mq` function and the `Breakpoint` enum?\n- The `mq` function is used to apply CSS styles based on the current screen size, using the `Breakpoint` enum to define specific breakpoints. This allows for responsive design and layout adjustments.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `insetBorder` and `contentGrid` functions?\n- The `insetBorder` function generates a CSS box shadow with specific border properties, while the `contentGrid` function generates a CSS grid layout with a specified number of columns. These functions are used to create consistent styling across the `TitleBar` component."
