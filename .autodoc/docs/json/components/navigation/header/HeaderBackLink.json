  "summary": "The code defines a React functional component called `HeaderBackLink` that renders a styled link with a chevron left icon and a title. The component takes two props: `title` and `href`, which are used to set the title and URL of the link, respectively. \n\nThe link is created using the `Link` component from the `next/link` library, which allows for client-side navigation between pages in a Next.js application. The `passHref` prop is passed to `Link` to ensure that the `href` prop is passed to the underlying `a` element.\n\nThe link is styled using the `StyledA` component from the `@emotion/styled` library. The styles include removing the default text decoration, setting margins and padding, displaying the link as a flex container with centered items, setting the font size and weight, and adding a border radius. The link has a transparent background by default, but changes to a light grey when hovered over. The `span` element within the link is styled with a bottom border to create an underline effect for the title. The `svg` element for the chevron icon is also styled with a margin and fixed width and height.\n\nThe `HeaderBackLink` component can be used in the larger project to create a consistent back button/link for navigating between pages. By passing in the `title` and `href` props, the link can be customized for each page. The use of `Link` ensures that the link is optimized for client-side navigation in a Next.js application. The use of `@emotion/styled` allows for easy customization of the link's styles. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n<HeaderBackLink title=\"Home\" href=\"/\" />\n```",
