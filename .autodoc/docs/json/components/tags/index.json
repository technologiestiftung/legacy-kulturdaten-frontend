  "summary": "The `Tags` component is a reusable React component that provides a user interface for selecting and displaying tags. It is part of the larger `kulturdaten-frontend` project and is located in a file on GitHub. The component is designed to be flexible and can be used in different contexts, such as in a form or as a standalone component.\n\nThe component uses several other components and libraries, such as `Autocomplete` and `TextField` from the Material UI library, `match-sorter` for filtering options, and `react-feather` for displaying icons. The component also uses several custom styled components for layout and styling.\n\nThe `Tags` component takes several props, including `options`, which is an array of tag objects, `value`, which is an array of selected tag IDs, and `onChange`, which is a callback function that is called when the selected tags change. The component also takes an optional `i18nKeys` prop, which is an object containing translation keys for various labels and messages used in the component.\n\nThe component renders a list of selected tags, an autocomplete input for selecting new tags, and a button for adding new tags. When a tag is selected, it is added to the list of selected tags and the `onChange` callback is called with the updated list of selected tag IDs. When a tag is removed from the list, the `onChange` callback is called again with the updated list of selected tag IDs.\n\nThe `Tags` component uses a reducer to manage the state of the selected tags. The reducer handles three actions: `add`, `delete`, and `init`. The `add` action adds a new tag ID to the list of selected tag IDs, the `delete` action removes a tag ID from the list of selected tag IDs, and the `init` action initializes the list of selected tag IDs with a value passed in the `value` prop.\n\nOverall, the `Tags` component provides a flexible and reusable user interface for selecting and displaying tags. It is designed to be easy to use and customize, and can be integrated into different parts of the `kulturdaten-frontend` project.",
