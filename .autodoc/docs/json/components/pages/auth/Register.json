  "summary": "The code above defines a React functional component called `RegisterPage`. This component is used to render a registration page for users to sign up for the application. \n\nThe component imports two modules: `AuthWrapper` and `RegisterForm`. `AuthWrapper` is a higher-order component that provides authentication functionality to its child components. It takes an image object as a prop, which is used to display an image on the registration page. The `RegisterForm` component is a form that allows users to input their registration information, such as their email and password.\n\nThe `RegisterPage` component returns the `AuthWrapper` component with the `RegisterForm` component as its child. The `AuthWrapper` component is passed an image object as a prop, which is used to display an image on the registration page. The `RegisterForm` component is rendered inside the `AuthWrapper` component and allows users to input their registration information.\n\nThis code is part of the larger `kulturdaten-frontend` project, which is a web application for cultural events and institutions in Berlin. The `RegisterPage` component is used to provide a registration page for users to sign up for the application. This component can be used in conjunction with other components to create a complete user authentication system for the application.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport { RegisterPage } from './components/auth/RegisterPage';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <RegisterPage />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
