  "summary": "The code above defines two React functional components, `ResetPasswordPage` and `RequestPasswordResetPage`, that are used to render the reset password and request password reset pages respectively in the Kulturdaten-frontend project. \n\nBoth components use the `AuthWrapper` component from the `../../auth/AuthWrapper` module to provide a consistent layout and styling for the pages. The `AuthWrapper` component takes an image prop that is used as the background image for the page. In this case, the `resetPasswordImage` imported from `../../../public/img/heye-jensen-uVIpeJE9X9c-unsplash.jpg` is used as the background image for both pages.\n\nThe `ResetPasswordPage` component renders the `ResetPasswordForm` component from the `../../auth/ResetPassword` module. This form is used to allow users to reset their password by entering their email address and a new password.\n\nThe `RequestPasswordResetPage` component renders the `RequestPasswordResetForm` component from the `../../auth/RequestPasswordReset` module. This form is used to allow users to request a password reset by entering their email address.\n\nOverall, these components provide a user-friendly interface for resetting and requesting password resets in the Kulturdaten-frontend project. They are used in conjunction with other authentication-related components and modules to provide a secure and seamless user experience. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport { ResetPasswordPage, RequestPasswordResetPage } from './authPages';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ResetPasswordPage />\n      <RequestPasswordResetPage />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `AuthWrapper` component?\n- The `AuthWrapper` component is used to wrap the `ResetPasswordForm` and `RequestPasswordResetForm` components and provide a consistent layout and styling for authentication-related pages.\n\n2. Where is the `resetPasswordImage` imported from?\n- The `resetPasswordImage` is imported from the `public/img` directory and is likely an image used as a background for the authentication pages.\n\n3. What is the difference between the `ResetPasswordPage` and `RequestPasswordResetPage` components?\n- The `ResetPasswordPage` component renders the `ResetPasswordForm` component, which allows a user to reset their password. The `RequestPasswordResetPage` component renders the `RequestPasswordResetForm` component, which allows a user to request a password reset email."
