  "summary": "The `OfferAudiencePage` component is a React functional component that renders a form for editing the audience and peak hours of an offer. It imports several helper functions and components from other files in the project.\n\nThe `useAudienceForm` hook is used to generate a form for editing the audience of the offer. It uses the `useGenericFormStructure` hook to generate a form based on the `offerAudience` configuration object. The `useApiCall` hook is used to make API calls to update the offer's audience. The `useEffect` hook is used to initialize the form with the current audience data from the offer. The `useMemo` hook is used to calculate the `valid` and `pristine` states of the form based on its current state and the initial audience data.\n\nThe `usePeakHoursForm` hook is used to generate a form for editing the peak hours of the offer. It uses the `useHoursField` hook to generate a form field for entering peak hours. The `useApiCall` hook is used to make API calls to update the offer's peak hours. The `useEffect` hook is used to initialize the form with the current peak hours data from the offer. The `useMemo` hook is used to calculate the `valid` and `pristine` states of the form based on its current state and the initial peak hours data.\n\nThe `OfferAudiencePage` component renders the forms generated by the `useAudienceForm` and `usePeakHoursForm` hooks, along with a `Save` button for saving changes to the offer. It also uses the `usePublish` hook to render a publish button for publishing the offer. The `useConfirmExit` hook is used to warn the user if they attempt to leave the page with unsaved changes. The `useState` hook is used to keep track of the `loaded` and `valid` states of the component. The `useEffect` hook is used to set the `loaded` state to `true` after a short delay to allow the component to render properly. The `useMemo` hook is used to calculate the `pristine` state of the component based on the `pristine` states of the audience and peak hours forms.",
