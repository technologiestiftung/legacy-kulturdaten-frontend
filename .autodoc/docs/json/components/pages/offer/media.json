  "summary": "The `OfferMediaPage` component is a React functional component that renders a form for creating or editing media entries in the context of a specific category. It is part of the larger `kulturdaten-frontend` project and uses several helper functions and hooks to manage state and handle user interactions.\n\nThe component takes in a `CategoryEntryPage` object as props, which includes the category and query parameters needed to fetch the corresponding entry data. It then uses the `useEntryHeader` and `useEntry` hooks to render the header and retrieve the entry data, respectively. The `useSaveDate` hook is used to format the date of the entry for display.\n\nThe component also uses the `useMediaForm` hook to manage the state of the media form, including handling form submission and validation. The `useConfirmExit` hook is used to prompt the user with a confirmation message if they attempt to leave the page with unsaved changes. The `usePublish` hook is used to render the publish button and handle the `onPublish` callback when the button is clicked.\n\nThe `onSave` function is a callback that is called when the save button is clicked. It calls the `submit` function from the `useMediaForm` hook to submit the form data to the server.\n\nThe component renders the publish button, entry header, save button, and media form in that order. The `renderedPublish` and `renderedEntryHeader` variables are JSX elements returned by the `usePublish` and `useEntryHeader` hooks, respectively. The `renderedForm` variable is a JSX element returned by the `useMediaForm` hook and is wrapped in `StyledEntryFormContainer` and `EntryFormWrapper` components for styling purposes.\n\nOverall, the `OfferMediaPage` component provides a reusable form for creating or editing media entries in the context of a specific category. It uses several helper functions and hooks to manage state and handle user interactions, making it a modular and extensible component within the larger `kulturdaten-frontend` project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file defines a React functional component called `OfferMediaPage` that renders a form for creating or editing media entries in a specific category.\n\n2. What are some of the custom hooks used in this code file?\n- The code file uses several custom hooks such as `useEntryHeader`, `useSaveDate`, `useMediaForm`, `useT`, `useConfirmExit`, and `usePublish` to manage state and functionality within the component.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `loaded` state variable?\n- The `loaded` state variable is used to delay the rendering of the media form until the component has fully loaded and the entry data has been retrieved from the API. This helps to prevent issues with form data being overwritten or lost during the initial render."
