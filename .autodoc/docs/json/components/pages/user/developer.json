  "summary": "The code defines two React functional components: `UserApiTokens` and `UserDeveloperPage`. \n\n`UserApiTokens` is a form that allows users to create and manage API tokens. It imports several components from the project's codebase, including `EntryFormHead`, `FormGrid`, `FormItem`, `Input`, `Textarea`, `Button`, `Info`, and `AppTokenList`. \n\nThe form has three input fields: `name`, `description`, and `url`. `name` is a required field that must be unique among all existing API tokens. `description` and `url` are optional fields. The form also has a submit button that is disabled until the `name` field is valid. When the form is submitted, it sends a POST request to the server to create a new API token with the specified attributes. If the request is successful, the form is reset and the list of API tokens is updated. \n\n`UserDeveloperPage` is a page that displays two components: `UserApiTokens` and a list of links to documentation. It imports `SettingsHeader`, `EntryFormWrapper`, `StyledEntryFormContainer`, `EntryFormHead`, `FormGrid`, `FormItem`, `DashboardLinkList`, and `StandardLinkType` from the project's codebase. \n\nThe `SettingsHeader` component is a header that displays the title \"Developer Settings\". The `EntryFormWrapper` component is a wrapper that applies some styles to its children. The `StyledEntryFormContainer` component is a container that applies some more styles to its children. The `EntryFormHead` component is a header that displays a title and an optional tooltip. The `FormGrid` and `FormItem` components are used to lay out the form fields. The `DashboardLinkList` component is a list of links that can be either internal or external. \n\nOverall, this code provides a user interface for creating and managing API tokens, as well as links to documentation for developers. It is part of a larger project that likely involves interacting with an API.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is responsible for rendering a form for creating and listing API tokens for a user.\n\n2. What libraries or frameworks are being used in this code?\n- This code is using several libraries and frameworks such as React, React hooks, and styled components.\n\n3. What is the role of the `useApiCall` hook in this code?\n- The `useApiCall` hook is used to make API calls to create and delete app tokens. It is imported from the `lib/api` module."
