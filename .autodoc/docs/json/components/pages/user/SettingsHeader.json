  "summary": "The code above defines a React functional component called `SettingsHeader`. This component is responsible for rendering the header section of the settings page in the Kulturdaten-frontend application. \n\nThe component imports several hooks and components from other files in the project. The `useUser` hook is used to retrieve the current user's information, while the `useT` and `useLocale` hooks are used for internationalization purposes. The `useActiveRoute` hook is used to determine which tab is currently active, and the `UserContext` is used to check if the user is inactive. The `EntryHeader` and `Tabs` components are also imported from other files in the project.\n\nThe `SettingsHeader` component returns an `EntryHeader` component with a title, subtitle, and tabs. The title is set to the translated string 'settings.title', while the subtitle is set to the current user's email address. The tabs are rendered using the `Tabs` component, which takes an array of link objects as a prop. Each link object has a title, href, isActive, and disabled property. The title is the text that appears on the tab, the href is the URL that the tab links to, isActive is a boolean that determines if the tab is currently active, and disabled is a boolean that determines if the tab is disabled.\n\nThe `SettingsHeader` component renders two tabs: 'Pers√∂nliche Einstellungen' and 'Entwickler:innen-Einstellungen'. The first tab links to the user settings page, while the second tab links to the developer settings page. The `isActive` property is set based on the current active route, which is determined using the `useActiveRoute` hook. The `disabled` property of the second tab is set to `userInactive`, which is a boolean value that is retrieved from the `UserContext`.\n\nOverall, the `SettingsHeader` component is a small but important part of the Kulturdaten-frontend application. It provides a header section for the settings page, which includes tabs for navigating between different settings pages. The component uses several hooks and components from other files in the project to retrieve and display the necessary information.",
