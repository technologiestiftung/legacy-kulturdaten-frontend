  "summary": "The code defines a custom hook called `useArrivalForm` that returns an object with properties used to render and submit a form for updating a location's arrival information. The hook takes an object with `category` and `query` properties as input.\n\nThe hook uses several other hooks and functions from the project's `lib` and `GenericForm` directories to create the form. It first calls `useEntry` to retrieve the current location entry and `useGenericFormStructure` to generate the form structure based on the `locationArrival` configuration object. It also uses `useApiCall` to make API requests.\n\nThe hook then sets up several state variables and effects to manage the form's behavior. It uses `useRef` to create a reference to the form element, `useState` to track the form's validity, and `useMemo` to store the initial service fields and the current service fields as arrays of `ServiceField` objects. It also defines a `pristine` variable that compares the initial and current service fields to determine if the form has been changed.\n\nThe hook returns an object with several properties. `renderedForm` is a JSX element that renders the form with the `renderedForm` property generated by `useGenericFormStructure`. `submit` is an async function that submits the form data to the API if the form is valid. `pristine` is a boolean that indicates if the form has been changed. `valid` is a boolean that indicates if the form is currently valid. `reset` is a function that does nothing, and `state` is the current state of the form.\n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable hook for generating and submitting a form for updating a location's arrival information. It uses several other hooks and functions from the project to manage the form's behavior and state.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a custom hook called `useArrivalForm` that returns a rendered form, submit function, and other form-related properties for a specific category of data.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code imports several functions and types from external modules, including `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `useState`, `useApiCall`, `useEntry`, and `GenericFormState`.\n\n3. What is the role of the `initialServiceFields` and `serviceFieldsState` variables?\n- `initialServiceFields` is a memoized value that represents the current service fields associated with a location entry, while `serviceFieldsState` is a memoized value that represents the current state of the form's service fields. These variables are used to initialize and update the form's state based on the current data in the system."
