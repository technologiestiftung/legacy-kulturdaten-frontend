  "summary": "The code in this file provides a set of styled components for use in forms in the `kulturdaten-frontend` project. \n\nThe `FormWrapper` component is the main component in this file. It wraps around a form and takes in several props, including `children`, `id`, `requirement`, and `requirementNotInFormItem`. The `children` prop is the form content, while the `id` prop is an optional ID for the form. The `requirement` prop is an object that contains a boolean value for whether the form is required or not, and the `requirementNotInFormItem` prop is a boolean value that determines whether the form requirement should be displayed outside of the form item. \n\nThe `FormRequiredInfo` component is used to display the form requirement information. It takes in a `fulfilled` prop, which is a boolean value that determines whether the form requirement has been fulfilled or not. \n\nThe `FormGrid` component is a styled component that displays the form items in a grid layout. It takes in a `noTopPadding` prop, which is a boolean value that determines whether the top padding should be removed. \n\nThe `FormItem` component is a styled component that wraps around a form item. It takes in several props, including `children`, `width`, `childWidth`, `alignSelf`, `childrenFlexGrow`, `alignEnd`, `css`, `lang`, and `id`. The `children` prop is the content of the form item, while the `width` prop is an enum that determines the width of the form item. The `childWidth` prop is an optional string that determines the width of the child element of the form item. The `alignSelf` prop is an optional string that determines the alignment of the form item. The `childrenFlexGrow` prop is an optional string that determines the flex-grow value of the child element of the form item. The `alignEnd` prop is a boolean value that determines whether the form item should be aligned to the end. The `css` prop is an optional serialized style that can be used to add additional styles to the form item. The `lang` prop is an optional string that determines the language of the form item. The `id` prop is an optional ID for the form item. \n\nThe other components in this file are styled components that are used within the main components. \n\nOverall, this file provides a set of reusable styled components for forms in the `kulturdaten-frontend` project. These components can be used to create consistent and visually appealing forms throughout the project.",
