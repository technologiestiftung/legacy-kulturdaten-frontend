  "summary": "The code defines a React functional component called `LocationAccessibilityPage` that renders a form for editing the accessibility information of a location. The component imports several helper functions and components from other files in the project.\n\nThe `useAccessibilityForm` hook is used to generate the form fields and handle form submission. It uses the `useEntry` hook to retrieve the current location data from the API and the `useGenericFormStructure` hook to generate the form fields based on the `locationAccessibility` configuration object. The hook also handles form validation and submission using the `useApiCall` hook to send a PATCH request to update the location data.\n\nThe `LocationAccessibilityPage` component renders the form generated by the `useAccessibilityForm` hook along with a header and a \"Save\" button. It also uses the `usePublish` hook to handle publishing the location data and the `useConfirmExit` hook to warn the user if they attempt to leave the page with unsaved changes.\n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable form component for editing the accessibility information of a location in the larger project.",

What is the purpose of the `useAccessibilityForm` hook?\n- The `useAccessibilityForm` hook is used to handle the form state and submission for the location accessibility page.\n\n2.
