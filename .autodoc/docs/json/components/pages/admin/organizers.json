  "summary": "The `AdminOrganizersPage` component is a React functional component that renders a page for managing organizers in the kulturdaten-frontend project. The component imports various hooks and components from different files in the project to achieve its functionality.\n\nThe component first imports the `Head` component from the `next/head` module, which is used to set the page title. It also imports various hooks such as `useRouter`, `useEffect`, `useCategories`, `useT`, `useLocale`, `useOrganizerId`, `useBreakpointOrWider`, `useAdminMode`, `useDownload`, and `useUser` from different files in the project.\n\nThe `useUser` hook is used to get the current user and their permissions, while the `useRouter` hook is used to get the current route. The `useLocale` hook is used to get the current locale, and the `useOrganizerId` hook is used to get the current organizer ID. The `useBreakpointOrWider` hook is used to determine if the screen width is at least medium-sized, and the `useAdminMode` hook is used to start the admin mode. The `useDownload` hook is used to download data, and the `useCategories` hook is used to get the categories for the project.\n\nThe `useEffect` hook is used to redirect non-superuser users to the dashboard. If the user is not a superuser, they are redirected to the dashboard route.\n\nThe component then renders the `EntryHeader` component, which displays the page title and a dropdown menu with export options. The `EntryFormWrapper` component is used to wrap the `OrganizerList` component, which displays a list of organizers. The `OrganizerList` component is passed various props such as `expandable`, `expanded`, `customEntryOnClick`, and `Context`.\n\nOverall, the `AdminOrganizersPage` component is a high-level component that renders a page for managing organizers in the kulturdaten-frontend project. It imports various hooks and components from different files in the project to achieve its functionality.",
