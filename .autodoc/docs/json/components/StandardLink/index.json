  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `StandardLink` that renders a link with standardized styling. The component takes three props: `type`, `href`, and `children`. \n\nThe `type` prop is an optional enum that specifies whether the link is internal or external. If `type` is not provided, it defaults to `StandardLinkType.internal`. \n\nThe `href` prop is a required string that specifies the URL that the link should point to. \n\nThe `children` prop is a required React node that specifies the content of the link. \n\nThe component first defines a styled anchor tag using the `@emotion/styled` library. This tag has no text decoration and inherits its color from its parent. \n\nNext, the component defines an internal link component called `InternalStandardLink`. This component wraps the styled anchor tag in a `next/link` component, which is used for client-side navigation in Next.js applications. The `passHref` prop is passed to the `Link` component to ensure that the anchor tag receives the `href` prop. \n\nFinally, the `StandardLink` component renders either the internal or external link component based on the `type` prop. If `type` is `StandardLinkType.internal`, the component renders the `InternalStandardLink` component. If `type` is `StandardLinkType.external`, the component renders the styled anchor tag with the `href`, `rel`, and `target` props set appropriately for an external link. If `type` is any other value, the component throws an error. \n\nThis component can be used throughout the project to render links with consistent styling. Developers can use the `type` prop to specify whether a link should be internal or external, and the component will handle the appropriate rendering. Here is an example usage of the component: \n\n```\n<StandardLink type={StandardLinkType.external} href=\"https://example.com\">\n  Example\n</StandardLink>\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `StandardLink` component?\n   - The `StandardLink` component is used to render links with consistent styling and behavior throughout the application, and can handle both internal and external links.\n2. What is the difference between `InternalStandardLink` and `StyledStandardLink`?\n   - `InternalStandardLink` is a component that wraps a `Link` component from the Next.js library and applies the `StyledStandardLink` styles to it. `StyledStandardLink` is a styled component that applies consistent link styles.\n3. What is the purpose of the `StandardLinkType` enum?\n   - The `StandardLinkType` enum is used to specify whether a link should be rendered as an internal or external link, and is used in the `StandardLink` component to determine which type of link to render."
