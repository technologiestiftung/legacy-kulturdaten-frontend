  "summary": "The code defines a React functional component called `RequestPasswordResetForm`. This component is responsible for rendering a form that allows users to request a password reset. The form consists of an email input field and a submit button. When the user submits the form, the component sends a request to the server to initiate the password reset process.\n\nThe component uses several other components and hooks from the project's codebase to implement its functionality. These include:\n\n- `useApiCall`: a custom hook that provides a convenient way to make API requests to the server.\n- `useLocale`: a custom hook that provides the current locale of the application.\n- `useT`: a custom hook that provides a translation function for translating text into the current locale.\n- `Input`: a custom input component that renders an input field with a label and placeholder text.\n- `Button`: a custom button component that renders a button with customizable color, size, and content position.\n- `Info`: a custom component that renders an information message.\n\nThe component defines several state variables using the `useState` hook. These include:\n\n- `email`: a string that holds the current value of the email input field.\n- `errors`: an array of objects that represent any errors that occur during the form submission process.\n- `success`: a boolean that indicates whether the form submission was successful.\n\nThe component defines a `submitHandler` function that is called when the user submits the form. This function first prevents the default form submission behavior and clears any existing errors. It then sends a request to the server using the `useApiCall` hook and the `authRequestPasswordResetFactory` function. If the request is successful, the function sets the `success` state variable to `true`. If the request fails, the function extracts any error messages from the response and adds them to the `errors` state variable.\n\nThe component renders different content depending on the value of the `success` state variable. If `success` is `false`, the component renders the form with the email input field and submit button. If `success` is `true`, the component renders a success message. If there are any errors, the component renders them as `Info` components below the form.\n\nOverall, this component provides a simple and user-friendly way for users to request a password reset. It uses several custom components and hooks from the project's codebase to implement its functionality and provides error messages to users if anything goes wrong during the form submission process.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a React component that renders a form for requesting a password reset.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses several external libraries, including React, a custom API hook called `useApiCall`, and routing utilities from `lib/routing`.\n\n3. What happens if there is an error submitting the form?\n- If there is an error submitting the form, the error message is parsed and displayed to the user using the `Info` component. The error message is also stored in state using the `setErrors` function."
