  "summary": "The `ResetPasswordForm` component is a React functional component that renders a form for resetting a user's password. It is part of the `kulturdaten-frontend` project and is located in the `Auth` directory. \n\nThe component imports several modules from the project's `lib` and `components` directories, including `useApiCall`, `useLocale`, `useT`, `routes`, `Button`, `Input`, `AuthContent`, `AuthFormContainer`, `AuthHead`, `AuthHeadline`, `AuthSubline`, `AuthWrapper`, `ButtonLink`, `Link`, and `Info`. \n\nThe component defines several state variables using the `useState` hook, including `password`, `passwordConfirmation`, `passwordConfirmationBlurred`, `errors`, `linkExpired`, and `success`. It also defines two constants, `passwordErrorId` and `requestErrorId`, and two memoized variables, `email` and `signature`, which are derived from the `router` object. \n\nThe component uses the `useEffect` hook to update the `errors` state variable when the `password` and `passwordConfirmation` variables change. If the passwords match, any existing password error is removed from the `errors` array. If the passwords do not match and the `passwordConfirmation` input has been blurred, a new password error is added to the `errors` array. \n\nThe component defines a `submitHandler` function that is called when the form is submitted. The function first clears any existing errors, then checks if the passwords match and if the `email` and `signature` variables are defined. If these conditions are met, the function calls the `authResetPasswordFactory` function from the `lib/api/routes/auth/resetPassword` module to reset the user's password. If the reset is successful, the `success` state variable is set to `true`. If the reset fails, the function sets the `errors` state variable to an array of error messages based on the error response from the API. If the error response indicates that the reset link has expired, the `linkExpired` state variable is set to `true`. \n\nThe component renders a form that includes two `Input` components for entering the new password and its confirmation, and a `Button` component for submitting the form. If the reset is successful, the component renders a `ButtonLink` component that links to the login page. If there are errors, the component renders an `Info` component for each error message. If the reset link has expired, the component renders a `ButtonLink` component that links to the password reset page. \n\nOverall, the `ResetPasswordForm` component provides a user-friendly interface for resetting a user's password and handles error messages and expired links gracefully. It is a reusable component that can be used in the larger `kulturdaten-frontend` project wherever password resets are required.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ResetPasswordForm` component?\n- The `ResetPasswordForm` component is used to handle resetting a user's password.\n\n2. What libraries and hooks are being used in this code?\n- The code is using React, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useState`, `useApiCall`, `useLocale`, `useRouter`, and `useT` hooks, as well as components from the project's `button`, `info`, and `input` modules.\n\n3. What happens when the user submits the form?\n- When the user submits the form, the `submitHandler` function is called. If the passwords match and the email and signature are present, an API call is made to reset the user's password. If the call is successful, the `success` state is set to `true`. If there is an error, the `errors` state is updated with the appropriate error message."
