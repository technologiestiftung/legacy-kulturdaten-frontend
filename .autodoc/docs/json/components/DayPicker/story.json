  "summary": "This code is a part of the kulturdaten-frontend project and it is responsible for rendering a DayPicker component. The DayPicker component is a calendar-like interface that allows users to select a date or a range of dates. \n\nThe code imports the necessary dependencies such as styled-components, Storybook, and the DayPicker component. It then defines a Storybook story for the DayPicker component. Storybook is a tool that allows developers to build and test UI components in isolation. The StoryWrapper component is defined using styled-components and it is used to wrap the DayPicker component. The EmbeddedComponent is a functional component that renders the StoryWrapper and the DayPicker component. It also uses the useState hook to manage the state of the selected date(s). \n\nThe DayPickerDefaultStory is a Storybook story that renders the EmbeddedComponent. This story can be used to test the DayPicker component and its functionality in isolation. \n\nOverall, this code is a small part of a larger project that is responsible for rendering a DayPicker component using Storybook. The DayPicker component can be used in various parts of the project where date selection is required. The Storybook story can be used to test the component in isolation and ensure that it is working as expected.",
