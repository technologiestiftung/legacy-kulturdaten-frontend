  "summary": "The code defines a story for a radio variant component and exports it for use in the larger project. The radio variant component is used to display a set of radio buttons with associated labels and descriptions. The component is defined in a separate file and imported into this file. The code also imports the `useState` hook from the React library and the `mq` function and `Breakpoint` enum from the project's `globals/Constants` file.\n\nThe `StoryWrapper` component is defined using the `styled` function from the `@emotion/styled` library. It sets some styles for a container element that will wrap the radio variant component. The styles include setting the display to flex, setting the padding, width, and flex-direction properties, and using the `mq` function to set different padding values for different screen sizes.\n\nThe `RadioVariantDefaultStory` function is defined as a Storybook story and exported for use in the larger project. It uses the `useState` hook to define a state variable `value` and a function `setValue` to update the state. The `RadioVariant` component is then rendered with some props, including the `value` and `onChange` props that use the state variables, a `name` prop to set the name of the radio button group, and an `options` prop that defines the radio button options and their associated labels and descriptions. The `options` prop is an array of objects, each with a `value`, `label`, and `children` property. The `value` property is the value of the radio button, the `label` property is the label displayed next to the radio button, and the `children` property is an array of React elements that define the description of the radio button option.\n\nOverall, this code defines a Storybook story for a radio variant component that can be used in the larger project to display a set of radio buttons with associated labels and descriptions. The `StoryWrapper` component sets some styles for a container element that wraps the radio variant component, and the `RadioVariantDefaultStory` function defines the state and props for the radio variant component.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `RadioVariant` component?\n   - The `RadioVariant` component is used to render a group of radio buttons with customizable options and labels.\n\n2. What is the `StoryWrapper` component used for?\n   - The `StoryWrapper` component is used to wrap the `RadioVariant` component in a flexbox container with padding and responsive styles.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `options` prop passed to the `RadioVariant` component?\n   - The `options` prop is used to define the individual radio button options, including their values, labels, and child components (in this case, paragraphs of text)."
