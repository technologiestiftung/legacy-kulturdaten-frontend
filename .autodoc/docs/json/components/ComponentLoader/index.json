  "summary": "The code above defines a React functional component called `ComponentLoader`. This component is responsible for rendering a loading spinner with a text message indicating that the application is currently loading. \n\nThe loading spinner is defined in the `StyledLoadingScreenWobbler` component, which is imported from the `../Loading/LoadingScreen` module. This component is styled using the `StyledLoader` and `StyledLoaderInner` styled components, which define the layout and positioning of the spinner and text message. \n\nThe `StyledLoader` component defines the outer container for the loading spinner and sets its width, height, padding, background color, and border radius. The `StyledLoaderInner` component defines the inner container for the spinner and text message and sets its position, width, height, and alignment properties. The `StyledLoaderInnerText` component sets the font size, line height, position, and color of the text message. \n\nThe `useT` hook is imported from the `../../lib/i18n` module and is used to translate the text message into the user's preferred language. The translated text is passed to the `StyledLoaderInnerText` component as a prop. \n\nThis component can be used throughout the application to indicate that a particular component or page is currently loading. It provides a consistent and visually appealing loading experience for the user. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { ComponentLoader } from './ComponentLoader';\n\nconst MyComponent: React.FC = () => {\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // simulate loading data\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      setIsLoading(false);\n    }, 2000);\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {isLoading ? (\n        <ComponentLoader />\n      ) : (\n        <div>Loaded content goes here</div>\n      )}\n    </>\n  );\n};\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a React component called `ComponentLoader` that displays a loading screen with a wobbler animation and a loading text.\n\n2. What is the role of the `useT` hook?\n   - The `useT` hook is used to access the translation function provided by the `i18n` library, which is used to translate the loading text displayed by the component.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `StyledLoader` and `StyledLoaderInner` components?\n   - The `StyledLoader` component defines the outer container of the loading screen, while the `StyledLoaderInner` component defines the inner container that holds the wobbler animation and loading text."
