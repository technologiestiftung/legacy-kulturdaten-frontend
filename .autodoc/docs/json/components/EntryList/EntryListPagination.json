  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `EntryListPagination` that renders a pagination control for a list of entries. The component takes several props including the current page number, the last page number, the number of entries per page, the total number of entries, and functions to handle navigation to the next, previous, or specific page. \n\nThe component renders a `StyledEntryListPagination` container with two child elements: `StyledEntryListPaginationInteractive` and `StyledEntryListPaginationSelect`. The former contains the navigation buttons and the latter contains a `Select` component that allows the user to jump to a specific page. The `StyledEntryListPagination` container has an optional `noHorizontalPadding` prop that removes horizontal padding if set to `true`.\n\nThe `Select` component is rendered only if `totalEntries` and `entriesPerPage` are truthy. It generates a list of options based on the total number of entries and the number of entries per page. Each option represents a page number and displays the current page number and the last page number using the `useT` hook for translation.\n\nThe navigation buttons are `Button` components from the `../button` module. The \"previous\" button is disabled if the current page is the first page. The \"next\" button is disabled if the current page is the last page. Both buttons have an icon and text label that can be translated using the `useT` hook.\n\nThe component is used in other parts of the `kulturdaten-frontend` project to provide pagination controls for lists of entries. It can be customized by passing different props to change the behavior or appearance of the pagination control. For example, setting `expanded` to `true` will display the `Select` component by default instead of hiding it behind a button.",
