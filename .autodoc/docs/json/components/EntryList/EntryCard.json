  "summary": "The code defines a reusable React component called `EntryCard` that renders a card-like UI element for displaying information about an entry. The component takes several props, including `title`, `status`, `createdDate`, `updatedDate`, `meta`, `menuExpanded`, `href`, `active`, `onClick`, `image`, and `forbidden`. \n\nThe `EntryCard` component is composed of several styled components, including `StyledEntryCardLink`, `StyledEntryCard`, `StyledEntryCardTop`, `StyledEntryCardTopLeft`, `StyledEntryCardTitle`, `StyledEntryCardMeta`, `StyledEntryCardImage`, `StyledEntryCardBottom`, `StyledEntryCardDates`, and `StyledEntryCardStatus`. These styled components define the visual appearance of the card and its various parts, such as the title, metadata, image, and status flag.\n\nThe `EntryCard` component also uses two other reusable components, `StatusFlag` and `EntryCardTypesSubjects`, to display the status and type/subject information of the entry, respectively.\n\nThe `EntryCard` component conditionally renders some of its parts based on the values of its props. For example, if an `image` prop is provided, the `StyledEntryCardImage` component is rendered to display the image. If an `href` prop is provided, the `EntryCard` component wraps itself in a `Link` component from the `next/link` library to make the card clickable and navigable.\n\nOverall, the `EntryCard` component is a flexible and reusable UI element that can be used throughout the project to display information about various types of entries. It can be customized by passing in different props to control its appearance and behavior.",
