  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `EntryListHead` that renders a header for a list of entries. The header consists of a title, an optional menu, an optional action button, and an optional list of actions. The header can also be expanded or collapsed using a button.\n\nThe component uses Emotion to define its styles. It imports the `css` and `styled` functions from Emotion, as well as two icons from the `react-feather` library. It also imports two utility functions from the project's `lib` directory: `useT` for internationalization and `useBreakpointOrWider` for responsive design.\n\nThe component's styles are defined using Emotion's `styled` function. The component is divided into several sub-components, each with its own set of styles. The top-level component is called `StyledEntryListHead` and has a white background. The `StyledEntryListHeadTitleRow` component contains the title and other elements on the right side of the header. The `StyledEntryListHeadTitle` component contains the title text and has an optional padding. The `StyledEntryListHeadActionButton` component contains the action button and has different styles depending on whether the header is expanded or not. The `StyledExpandableButton` component contains the expand/collapse button.\n\nThe `EntryListHead` component takes several props:\n\n- `title`: the title text to display\n- `actionButton`: an optional React node to display as the action button\n- `actions`: an optional array of React elements to display as actions\n- `expanded`: a boolean indicating whether the header is expanded or not\n- `setExpanded`: an optional function to call when the expand/collapse button is clicked\n- `expandable`: a boolean indicating whether the header can be expanded or not\n- `noPadding`: a boolean indicating whether the title should have no padding\n- `menu`: an optional React element to display as a menu\n\nThe component uses the `useBreakpointOrWider` hook to determine whether the screen width is at least `Breakpoint.mid`. If it is, the expand/collapse button is displayed.\n\nThe component renders the header using the defined sub-components and the provided props. If the header is expanded, it displays the action button and the list of actions. If it is collapsed, it only displays the action button. If the header is expandable, it displays the expand/collapse button. When the button is clicked, it calls the `setExpanded` function if provided.\n\nOverall, this component provides a flexible and responsive header for a list of entries, with optional actions and expand/collapse functionality. It can be used in various parts of the project where such a header is needed.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `EntryListHead` component?\n- The `EntryListHead` component is a React functional component that renders a header for a list of entries, with optional expand/collapse functionality, action buttons, and a menu.\n\n2. What is the role of the `useT` hook?\n- The `useT` hook is used to access the translation function provided by the i18n library, which allows for localization of the component's text content.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `mq` function?\n- The `mq` function is a utility function that generates media query styles based on the provided breakpoint value, which is defined in the `WindowService` module. It is used to apply responsive styles to the `StyledEntryListHeadTitleRow` component based on the screen width."
