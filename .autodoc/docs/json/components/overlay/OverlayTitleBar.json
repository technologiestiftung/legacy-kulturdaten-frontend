  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `OverlayTitleBar` that renders a title bar for an overlay. The component takes in three props: `title`, `sticky`, and `actions`. \n\nThe `title` prop is a string that represents the title of the overlay. The `sticky` prop is a boolean that determines whether the title bar should be sticky or not. If `sticky` is true, the title bar will be fixed to the top of the screen when the user scrolls. The `actions` prop is an array of React elements that represent actions that can be performed on the overlay.\n\nThe component is styled using the `styled` function from the `@emotion/styled` library. The `StyledOverlayTitleBar` component is a styled `div` that has a white background, a box shadow, and rounded corners. It also has a flexbox layout with a row direction and space between the items. If the `sticky` prop is true, the `position` property is set to `sticky` and the `top` and `left` properties are set to `0`.\n\nThe `StyledOverlayTitleBarTitle` component is a styled `div` that represents the title of the overlay. It has a font size of `var(--font-size-400)`, a line height of `var(--line-height-400)`, and a font weight of `700`.\n\nThe `StyledOverlayTitleBarActions` component is a styled `div` that represents the actions that can be performed on the overlay. It has a flexbox layout with a row direction and space between the items.\n\nThe `StyledOverlayTitleBarAction` component is a styled `div` that represents an individual action that can be performed on the overlay. It has a margin left of `0.75rem` and a padding of `0.375rem 0`.\n\nThe `OverlayTitleBar` component renders the `StyledOverlayTitleBar` component with the `sticky` prop passed in. It also renders the `StyledOverlayTitleBarTitle` component with the `title` prop passed in. If the `actions` prop is not null, it renders the `StyledOverlayTitleBarActions` component with each action in the `actions` array rendered as a `StyledOverlayTitleBarAction` component.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to provide a consistent and customizable title bar for overlays. The `title` prop can be used to set the title of the overlay, while the `actions` prop can be used to add custom actions to the title bar. The `sticky` prop can be used to make the title bar sticky if needed.",
