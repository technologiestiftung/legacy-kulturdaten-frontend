  "summary": "This code defines a set of components and functions related to overlays in the kulturdaten-frontend project. Overlays are UI elements that appear on top of the main content and provide additional information or functionality. \n\nThe code imports several dependencies, including styled components, Storybook, and React. It defines a few styled components that are used to create the appearance of the overlay content. The `OverlayExample` component is the main component that renders the overlay. It takes two boolean props, `renderTitlebar` and `stickyTitlebar`, which determine whether to show a title bar at the top of the overlay and whether it should be sticky (i.e., remain visible when the user scrolls). \n\nThe `OverlayExample` component uses the `useOverlay` hook to manage the state of the overlay. This hook takes two arguments: the content to be displayed in the overlay and a boolean indicating whether the overlay is initially open. The content is defined as a JSX element that includes the title bar (if `renderTitlebar` is true) and the main content of the overlay. The main content is a grid of boxes, each containing the text \"Test Content\". \n\nThe `OverlayExample` component also renders a button that opens the overlay when clicked. When the overlay is open, it is displayed on top of the main content, and the `renderedOverlay` variable is set to the content of the overlay. The `overlayOpen` variable is obtained from the `NavigationContext` and is used to display whether the overlay is currently open or closed. \n\nFinally, the code defines three Storybook stories that demonstrate the different configurations of the `OverlayExample` component. These stories show the overlay with a sticky title bar, a non-sticky title bar, and no title bar at all. \n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and reusable way to create overlays in the kulturdaten-frontend project. By defining the appearance and behavior of the overlay in a single component, it makes it easy to add overlays to different parts of the application and customize them as needed.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useOverlay` hook being imported from `'.'`?\n   - The `useOverlay` hook is used to manage the state of the overlay component and its visibility.\n2. What is the purpose of the `OverlayTitleBar` component being imported from `'./OverlayTitleBar'`?\n   - The `OverlayTitleBar` component is used to render a title bar with optional actions for the overlay component.\n3. What is the purpose of the `NavigationContext` being imported from `'../navigation/NavigationContext'`?\n   - The `NavigationContext` is used to access the state of the navigation component and determine if the overlay is currently open or closed."
