  "summary": "This code defines two stories for a Table component using the Storybook library. The Table component is imported from a local file, and the Storybook Story component is imported from the Storybook React package. \n\nThe first story, `TableDefaultStory`, renders a Table component with default styling and a set of columns and content. The columns are defined as an array of objects, each with a `title` property that specifies the column header text and an optional `bold` property that, if true, makes the header text bold. The `content` prop is an array of objects, each with a `contents` property that is itself an array of strings representing the cell values for that row. \n\nThe second story, `TableNarrowStory`, is identical to the first except that it adds a `narrow` prop to the Table component, which applies a narrower style to the table cells. \n\nThese stories are intended to showcase the Table component and its various styling options to developers working on the larger project. By using Storybook, developers can easily see how the component looks and behaves in different scenarios without having to navigate to different parts of the application. \n\nHere is an example of how the `TableDefaultStory` might be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Table } from './Table';\nimport { fetchTableData } from './api';\n\nfunction MyTableComponent() {\n  const [tableData, setTableData] = React.useState([]);\n\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    fetchTableData().then(data => setTableData(data));\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <Table\n      columns={[\n        { title: 'Name', bold: true },\n        { title: 'Age' },\n        { title: 'Location' },\n      ]}\n      content={tableData}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyTableComponent` fetches data from an API and renders a Table component with the fetched data. The `columns` prop specifies the column headers, and the `content` prop is set to the fetched data. This component could be used in various parts of the application to display tabular data.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines two stories for a Table component using Storybook, one with default width and one with narrow width, and provides test content for the component.\n\n2. What is the format of the `columns` prop for the Table component?\n   - The `columns` prop is an array of objects, where each object represents a column and has a `title` property for the column header text and an optional `bold` property to make the header text bold.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `narrow` prop for the Table component?\n   - The `narrow` prop is used to make the Table component narrower by reducing the padding and font size of the cells."
