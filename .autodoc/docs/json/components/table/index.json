  "summary": "The code defines a reusable `Table` component that can be used to display tabular data. The component takes in an array of `columns` and an array of `content` as props. The `columns` array defines the column headers and their properties, such as `title`, `width`, and `sort`. The `content` array defines the rows of data to be displayed.\n\nThe `Table` component uses `styled-components` to define the styles for the table, rows, and cells. It also uses the `useMemo` hook to calculate the total number of columns based on the `width` property of each column.\n\nThe `Table` component renders the table using a combination of `div` elements and CSS grid. It also uses the `TableContext` and `TableContextProvider` components to pass down the `narrow` prop to child components.\n\nThe `Table` component also includes a `placeholder` prop that can be used to display a message when there is no data to be displayed.\n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and reusable way to display tabular data in a consistent and customizable way. It can be used in various parts of the `kulturdaten-frontend` project to display data in a table format.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Table` component?\n- The `Table` component is used to render a table with customizable columns and content.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `TableContext` and `TableContextProvider` components?\n- The `TableContext` and `TableContextProvider` components are used to provide a context for the `Table` component, specifically to determine whether the table should be rendered in a narrow or wide format.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `StyledCellSort` component?\n- The `StyledCellSort` component is used to render a clickable button that allows the user to sort the table by a specific column."
