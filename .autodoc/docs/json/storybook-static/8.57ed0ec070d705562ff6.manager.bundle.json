  "summary": "The code provided is a function that returns a Promise object that makes an HTTP request to a specified URL. The function takes two parameters: the URL to request and an optional object containing additional request options. \n\nThe function uses the XMLHttpRequest API to create a new HTTP request object. It then sets the request method (defaulting to \"get\" if not specified in the options), the URL, and whether or not to use credentials (defaulting to false if not specified in the options). It also sets any additional headers specified in the options object. \n\nOnce the request is sent, the function sets up event listeners for the response. If the response is successful (status code 2xx), it extracts the response headers and body and returns them as a Promise object. If the response is unsuccessful, it calls the error callback function specified in the options object. \n\nThis function can be used in the larger project to make HTTP requests to the backend API and retrieve data to display on the frontend. It can be called from other functions or components in the project that need to fetch data from the server. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport makeRequest from './makeRequest';\n\nconst fetchData = async () => {\n  try {\n    const response = await makeRequest('https://example.com/api/data');\n    const data = await response.json();\n    console.log(data);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(error);\n  }\n}\n\nfetchData();\n```\n\nIn this example, the `fetchData` function uses `makeRequest` to fetch data from the specified URL. It then parses the response body as JSON and logs it to the console. If an error occurs, it logs the error to the console.",
  "questions": "1. What does this code do?\n    \n    This code exports a function that takes in a URL and an optional configuration object, and returns a Promise that resolves with an XMLHttpRequest object that can be used to make an HTTP request to the specified URL with the specified configuration.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the configuration object?\n    \n    The configuration object is optional and can be used to specify additional options for the HTTP request, such as the HTTP method, request body, headers, and credentials.\n\n3. How can this code be used in a web application?\n    \n    This code can be used in a web application to make HTTP requests to a server and retrieve data asynchronously. The returned Promise can be used to handle the response data and any errors that may occur during the request."
