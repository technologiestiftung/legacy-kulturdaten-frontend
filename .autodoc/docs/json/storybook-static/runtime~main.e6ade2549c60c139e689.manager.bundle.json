  "summary": "The code provided is a minified version of the webpack runtime code. Webpack is a module bundler that takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. The purpose of this code is to handle the loading and execution of modules in the browser. \n\nThe code defines a function called `webpackJsonpCallback` that is called when a new chunk of code is loaded. The function takes an array of data that contains information about the chunk, including the module ID, chunk ID, and the code to execute. The function then loops through the chunk IDs and checks if the chunk has already been installed. If it has, the function pushes the installed chunk to an array of resolved chunks. If it hasn't, the function creates a new promise and adds it to the array of promises for the chunk. It then creates a new script element and sets its source to the URL of the chunk. Once the script is loaded, the promise is resolved and the code is executed.\n\nThe code also defines several helper functions for loading and executing modules, including `__webpack_require__`, `__webpack_require__.e`, `__webpack_require__.t`, and `__webpack_require__.n`. These functions are used to load and execute modules and their dependencies.\n\nOverall, this code is an essential part of the webpack runtime and is used to load and execute modules in the browser. It is not meant to be modified directly, but rather is generated by webpack during the build process.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   \n   This code is a webpack runtime that handles module loading and chunk splitting for the kulturdaten-frontend project.\n\n2. What does the `webpackJsonpCallback` function do?\n   \n   The `webpackJsonpCallback` function is called when a chunk is loaded and it updates the `installedChunks` object and resolves any promises waiting for that chunk.\n\n3. What is the role of the `__webpack_require__` function?\n   \n   The `__webpack_require__` function is the main function used to load modules in the webpack runtime. It checks if a module is already loaded and if not, it loads it using the `modules` object and the `webpackJsonp` function."
