  "summary": "This file contains a list of external dependencies used in the kulturdaten-frontend project. Each dependency is listed with its name, version, and license. \n\nThe purpose of this file is to provide transparency and clarity on the external libraries and code used in the project. It allows developers and users to easily see what third-party code is being used and under what license it is distributed. This is important for legal and security reasons, as well as for understanding the functionality and behavior of the project as a whole.\n\nFor example, one of the dependencies listed is React Router DOM v6.2.1, which is a library for routing in React applications. This library allows developers to define routes and navigation in their application, making it easier to manage complex user interfaces. By including this library in the project, the developers of kulturdaten-frontend are able to take advantage of this functionality without having to write it themselves.\n\nAnother dependency listed is Fuse.js v3.6.1, which is a lightweight fuzzy-search library. This library allows developers to implement search functionality in their application that can handle misspellings and partial matches. By including this library in the project, the developers of kulturdaten-frontend are able to provide a more robust search experience for users.\n\nOverall, this file serves as a reference for the external dependencies used in the kulturdaten-frontend project and highlights the importance of understanding and managing third-party code in software development.",
