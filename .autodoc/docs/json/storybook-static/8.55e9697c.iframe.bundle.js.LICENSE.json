  "summary": "This code is a header comment for the OverlayScrollbars library, which is a third-party library used in the Kulturdaten-frontend project. The purpose of this library is to provide custom scrollbars for web pages that can be styled and customized to fit the design of the website. \n\nThe header comment provides information about the version of the library, the author, and the license under which it is released. The MIT license is a permissive open-source license that allows users to modify and distribute the code with few restrictions.\n\nIn the context of the Kulturdaten-frontend project, this library is likely used to enhance the user experience of scrolling through content on the website. By using custom scrollbars, the website can provide a more cohesive and visually appealing design. \n\nHere is an example of how the OverlayScrollbars library might be used in the Kulturdaten-frontend project:\n\n```javascript\nimport OverlayScrollbars from 'overlayscrollbars';\n\nconst options = {\n  className: 'os-theme-light',\n  scrollbars: {\n    autoHide: 'move',\n    autoHideDelay: 500\n  }\n};\n\nconst element = document.querySelector('.scrollable-content');\n\nOverlayScrollbars(element, options);\n```\n\nIn this example, the `OverlayScrollbars` function is imported from the library and called on a DOM element with the class `scrollable-content`. The `options` object is passed as a second argument to customize the appearance and behavior of the scrollbars. The resulting scrollbars will have a light theme and will automatically hide after 500 milliseconds of inactivity.",
