  "summary": "The code provided is a JavaScript library called Prism, which is used for syntax highlighting. It is licensed under the MIT license and was created by Lea Verou. The library is designed to be lightweight, robust, and elegant, making it a popular choice for developers who want to add syntax highlighting to their projects.\n\nPrism is a namespace that contains a number of public methods and properties that can be used to customize the syntax highlighting behavior. These methods and properties can be accessed by including the Prism library in your project and then calling them as needed.\n\nOne of the key features of Prism is its ability to automatically detect the language of the code being highlighted. This is done using a process called language detection, which involves analyzing the code to determine its syntax and then applying the appropriate highlighting rules.\n\nPrism also supports a wide range of languages and syntaxes, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Python, and many others. This makes it a versatile tool that can be used in a variety of different projects.\n\nHere is an example of how to use Prism to highlight code:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Prism Example</title>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"prism.css\">\n  <script src=\"prism.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\n    function helloWorld() {\n      console.log(\"Hello, world!\");\n    }\n  </code></pre>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn this example, we include the Prism CSS and JavaScript files in the head of our HTML document. We then use the `pre` and `code` tags to wrap our code, and we add the `language-javascript` class to tell Prism which language to highlight. When the page is loaded, Prism will automatically detect the language and apply the appropriate highlighting rules.\n\nOverall, Prism is a powerful and flexible tool for adding syntax highlighting to your projects. Its lightweight design and support for a wide range of languages make it a popular choice among developers.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code is a comment block that provides information about the Prism library, including its license, author, and namespace.\n\n2. What is the Prism library used for?\n   The code does not provide information about how the Prism library is used in the project, so a developer may need to investigate further to determine its purpose.\n\n3. Are there any dependencies required for the Prism library to work?\n   The code does not provide information about any dependencies required for the Prism library to work, so a developer may need to consult the project documentation or source code to determine this."
