  "summary": "The code defines a custom hook called `useConfirmExit` that is used to warn users before they leave a page. The hook takes in three arguments: `shouldWarn`, a boolean that determines whether the user should be warned before leaving the page; `message`, a string that contains the warning message to be displayed to the user; and `onAbort`, an optional callback function that is called when the user decides to stay on the page.\n\nThe hook uses several other hooks and context providers to determine whether the user should be warned before leaving the page. It uses the `useRouter` hook from the `next/router` package to get the current route and listen for route changes. It also uses the `useContext` hook to get the `UserContext` and `WindowContext` contexts, which contain information about the user and the current window.\n\nThe hook sets up several event listeners to detect when the user is about to leave the page. It listens for the `beforeunload` event, which is triggered when the user tries to close the window or navigate away from the page. It also listens for the `routeChangeStart` event, which is triggered when the user navigates to a new page within the app.\n\nWhen the user tries to leave the page, the hook checks whether the user is authenticated and whether they have already been warned about leaving the page. If the user is authenticated and has not been warned, the hook displays the warning message and waits for the user to confirm or cancel. If the user confirms, the hook calls the `onAbort` callback function (if provided) and allows the user to leave the page. If the user cancels, the hook prevents the user from leaving the page and continues to listen for further attempts to leave.\n\nOverall, this hook is used to provide a warning to users before they leave a page, which can be useful in preventing accidental navigation away from important information or unsaved changes. It can be used in any component that needs to provide this functionality, and can be customized with different warning messages and callback functions.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useConfirmExit` hook?\n- The `useConfirmExit` hook is used to warn the user before they navigate away from the current page if certain conditions are met, such as if the user is authenticated and the page has been rendered.\n\n2. What are the parameters of the `useConfirmExit` hook?\n- The `useConfirmExit` hook takes in three parameters: `shouldWarn` (a boolean indicating whether the user should be warned before navigating away), `message` (the message to display in the warning), and `onAbort` (an optional callback function to execute if the user chooses to abort the navigation).\n\n3. What React hooks are used in the `useConfirmExit` hook?\n- The `useConfirmExit` hook uses the `useRouter` and `useContext` hooks from the `next/router` and `react` packages, respectively, as well as the `useLocale` hook from a custom `routing` module and the `useContext` hook from a custom `WindowService` module. It also uses the `useEffect` hook to set up and clean up event listeners."
