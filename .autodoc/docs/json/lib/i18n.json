  "summary": "The code above is a module that provides localization functionality for the kulturdaten-frontend project. It exports two functions: `t` and `useT`. \n\nThe `t` function is used to access localized content. It takes three parameters: `locale`, `key`, and `params`. The `locale` parameter specifies the requested locale, which is an enum defined in the `locales.ts` file. The `key` parameter is a string in dot-notation that specifies the key to the entry in the localization object. The `params` parameter is an optional object that contains parameters needed by the entry. The function returns a string or a rendered React element.\n\nThe `useT` function is a hook that returns the `t` function with the current locale already injected. It uses the `useLocale` hook from the `routing.ts` file to get the current locale. It then uses the `useMemo` hook to memoize the corrected locale, which is the current locale or the default locale if the current locale is undefined or the catch-all locale. Finally, it uses the `useCallback` hook to memoize the `t` function with the corrected locale already injected. The function returns the memoized `t` function or a function that returns undefined if the corrected locale is undefined.\n\nThe module also defines two types: `LocalizationParams` and `Localization`. The `LocalizationParams` type is an object that contains parameters needed by a localization entry. The `Localization` type is an object that contains localization entries. A localization entry can be either a `localizationFunction` or another `Localization` object. A `localizationFunction` is a function that takes a `LocalizationParams` object and returns a string or a rendered React element.\n\nOverall, this module provides a simple and flexible way to localize content in the kulturdaten-frontend project. Developers can use the `t` function to access localized content and the `useT` hook to access the `t` function with the current locale already injected. The module also provides types for localization parameters and entries, making it easier to write and maintain localized content.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `t` function?\n   \n   The `t` function is used to access localized contents based on the requested locale, key, and optional parameters, and returns a string or rendered ReactElement.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `useT` hook?\n   \n   The `useT` hook is used to provide the `t` function with the current locale without manually injecting it, and returns a callback function that can be used to access localized contents.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Localization` type?\n   \n   The `Localization` type is used to define a nested object structure that contains either a localization function or another `Localization` object, which is used to organize and access localized contents in a hierarchical manner."
