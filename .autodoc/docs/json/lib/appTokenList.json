  "summary": "The code above is a React hook that fetches a list of app tokens from an API endpoint using the SWR library. The purpose of this hook is to provide a convenient way for other components in the project to access and manipulate the list of app tokens.\n\nThe hook is exported as `useAppTokenList` and takes no arguments. When called, it returns an object with two properties: `appTokens` and `mutate`.\n\nThe `appTokens` property is an array of app token attributes. These attributes are defined in the `AppToken` type, which is imported from `./api/types/appToken`. The `data` property of the app token response is accessed using the optional chaining operator (`?.`) and the `body` and `meta` properties are used to extract the app token attributes.\n\nThe `mutate` property is a function that can be called to trigger a re-fetch of the app token list. This can be useful if the list has been updated by another component and needs to be refreshed.\n\nThe hook uses the `useApiCall` function from `./api` to make the API request. This function returns a function that takes a factory function and optional arguments. The factory function in this case is `appTokenListFactory`, which is imported from `./api/routes/appToken/list`. This function generates the request payload for the app token list endpoint.\n\nThe `useSWR` function from the SWR library is used to handle the caching and re-fetching of the app token list. The first argument to `useSWR` is the API endpoint URL, which is imported from `./api`. The second argument is a function that returns the result of calling the `appTokenListFactory` function using the `call` function from `./api`. The third argument is an options object that disables revalidation on focus and sets a focus throttle interval of 5 minutes.\n\nOverall, this hook provides a simple and efficient way for other components in the project to access and manipulate the app token list. It abstracts away the details of making the API request and handling the caching and re-fetching of the data.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useAppTokenList` function?\n   - The `useAppTokenList` function is used to fetch a list of app tokens from the API and return them along with a `mutate` function to update the data.\n\n2. What is the `useSWR` hook and how is it used in this code?\n   - `useSWR` is a data fetching hook that is used to fetch data from the API and manage the state of the data. In this code, it is used to fetch the app token list from the API and revalidate the data when necessary.\n\n3. What is the `AppToken` type and where is it defined?\n   - The `AppToken` type is a custom type defined in the `./api/types/appToken` file. It represents the structure of an app token object returned by the API and is used in this code to define the shape of the app token data."
