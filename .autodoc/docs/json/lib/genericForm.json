  "summary": "This file defines a set of types and interfaces that are used to define form fields and categories in the larger project. The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized way of defining form fields and categories that can be used across the project.\n\nThe `GenericFormField` interface defines a generic form field that can be of various types, such as `select`, `input`, `textarea`, `radioList`, `checkboxList`, `tags`, or `conditional`. Each form field has a `key` that is used to identify it, a `type` that specifies the type of the field, and a `data` object that contains additional information specific to the type of the field. For example, an `input` field has a `type` property that specifies the type of input (e.g. `url`, `number`, `email`, `text`, or `tel`), while a `select` field has an `options` property that specifies the available options.\n\nThe `GenericFormCategory` interface defines a category of form fields, which is a collection of `GenericFormFieldGroup` objects. Each group contains a set of form fields that are logically related, and can be collapsed or expanded depending on the user's preference.\n\nThe `GenericFormFieldConditional` interface defines a form field that is conditionally displayed based on the value of another field. It contains a `fields` property that is an array of form fields that are displayed when the condition is met.\n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and extensible way of defining form fields and categories that can be used throughout the project. For example, a form for creating a new event could use these types to define the various fields and categories needed to collect information about the event.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines types and interfaces for form fields and categories in the kulturdaten-frontend project.\n\n2. What are some examples of form field types that are defined in this code?\n   Examples of form field types defined in this code include select, input, textarea, radioList, checkboxList, tags, and conditional.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the GenericFormCategory interface?\n   The GenericFormCategory interface defines a category of form fields, which can contain multiple groups of form fields and can be collapsible."
