  "summary": "The code above defines a set of regular expressions and functions that are used to validate user input in a web application. The regular expressions are used to check whether a given string matches a specific pattern, while the functions use these regular expressions to determine whether a given input is valid or not.\n\nThe `urlRegExpString` constant defines a regular expression that matches URLs, including both HTTP and HTTPS protocols. The `urlRegExp` constant creates a new regular expression object based on this string. Similarly, the `emailRegExpString` and `telRegExpString` constants define regular expressions that match email addresses and phone numbers, respectively. The `emailRegExp` and `telRegExp` constants create new regular expression objects based on these strings.\n\nThe `isUrl`, `isEmail`, and `isPhoneNumber` functions take a string as input and return a boolean value indicating whether the input matches the corresponding regular expression. For example, `isUrl` returns `true` if the input is a valid URL and `false` otherwise.\n\nThe `getErrorString` function takes two arguments: an `inputType` and a `value`. The `inputType` argument is an enum value that specifies the type of input being validated (e.g. URL, email, phone number). The `value` argument is the actual user input that needs to be validated. The function uses a switch statement to determine which regular expression to use based on the `inputType` argument, and then calls the corresponding validation function (`isUrl`, `isEmail`, or `isPhoneNumber`) to check whether the input is valid. If the input is not valid, the function returns a string that corresponds to an error message. Otherwise, it returns `undefined`.\n\nThis code is likely used in the larger project to validate user input in various forms and input fields throughout the web application. By using regular expressions and functions to validate user input, the application can ensure that the data it receives is in the correct format and meets certain criteria (e.g. a valid email address). This can help prevent errors and improve the overall user experience. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { InputType, isUrl, isEmail, isPhoneNumber, getErrorString } from \"./inputValidation\";\n\nconst urlInput = \"https://example.com\";\nconst emailInput = \"user@example.com\";\nconst phoneInput = \"+1 (555) 123-4567\";\n\nif (isUrl(urlInput)) {\n  console.log(\"Valid URL\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"Invalid URL\");\n}\n\nif (isEmail(emailInput)) {\n  console.log(\"Valid email\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"Invalid email\");\n}\n\nif (isPhoneNumber(phoneInput)) {\n  console.log(\"Valid phone number\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"Invalid phone number\");\n}\n\nconst urlError = getErrorString(InputType.url, \"invalid-url\");\nconst emailError = getErrorString(InputType.email, \"invalid-email\");\nconst phoneError = getErrorString(InputType.tel, \"invalid-phone\");\n\nconsole.log(urlError); // \"forms.urlInvalid\"\nconsole.log(emailError); // \"forms.emailInvalid\"\nconsole.log(phoneError); // \"forms.phoneInvalid\"\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code exports functions and regular expressions for validating URLs, email addresses, and phone numbers, as well as a function for getting error strings based on input type and value.\n\n2. What input types are supported by the `getErrorString` function?\n   - The `getErrorString` function supports input types of `url`, `email`, and `tel`.\n\n3. What is the format of the regular expression used to validate phone numbers?\n   - The regular expression used to validate phone numbers matches strings that start with an optional plus sign, followed by an optional set of parentheses containing up to four digits, followed by any combination of digits, spaces, hyphens, periods, forward slashes, and zeroes."
