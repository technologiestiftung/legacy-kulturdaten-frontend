  "summary": "The code defines various types and interfaces related to organizers in the kulturdaten-frontend project. An organizer is an entity that can organize cultural events and activities. \n\nThe `Organizer` type is the main interface that defines the structure of an organizer. It has various attributes such as `homepage`, `email`, `phone`, and `relations` that include other related entities such as `links`, `subjects`, `translations`, `types`, `media`, `logo`, `tags`, `contacts`, `roles`, and `mainContact`. \n\nThe `OrganizerTranslation` type defines the structure of a translation for an organizer. It includes attributes such as `language`, `name`, and `description`. \n\nThe `CreateOrganizer` type is used for creating a new organizer. It includes relations such as `links`, `translations`, `address`, `types`, and `subjects`. \n\nThe other types and interfaces such as `OrganizerType`, `OrganizerSubject`, `OrganizerRole`, `OrganizerMainContact`, etc. are used to define related entities for an organizer. \n\nOverall, this code provides a structured way to define and manage organizers and their related entities in the kulturdaten-frontend project. It can be used to create, update, and retrieve organizers and their details. For example, to create a new organizer, one can use the `CreateOrganizer` type and provide the necessary details such as name, description, address, etc. and then send a request to the backend API to create the organizer. Similarly, to retrieve an organizer, one can use the `Organizer` type and send a request to the backend API to get the details of the organizer.",
