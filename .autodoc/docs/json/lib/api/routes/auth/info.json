  "summary": "The code defines an interface and a factory function for making API calls to retrieve user authentication information from the backend server. The `AuthInfo` interface extends the `ApiCall` interface and specifies the request and response types for the `/auth/info` endpoint. The request object includes the route, method, headers (including the authorization token), and an empty body. The response object specifies a 200 status code and a body containing a `User` object.\n\nThe `authInfoFactory` function takes an authorization token as input and returns an `AuthInfo` object with the appropriate request and response properties. The `makeBearer` function is used to format the token as a bearer token for the `Authorization` header.\n\nThis code is likely used in the larger project to authenticate users and retrieve their user information from the backend server. The `AuthInfo` interface and `authInfoFactory` function provide a standardized way to make API calls to the `/auth/info` endpoint, which can be used throughout the project. For example, other parts of the project may call `authInfoFactory` with a user's authorization token to retrieve their user information and use it to customize the user interface or restrict access to certain features.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nconst token = 'my-auth-token';\nconst authInfo = authInfoFactory(token);\n\n// Make API call to retrieve user information\nfetch(authInfo.request.route, {\n  method: authInfo.request.method,\n  headers: authInfo.request.headers,\n  body: authInfo.request.body,\n})\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(data => {\n    // Use user information to customize UI or restrict access\n    const user = data.data;\n    // ...\n  });\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `AuthInfo` interface?\n   - The `AuthInfo` interface defines the structure of an API call to the `/auth/info` endpoint, including the request headers and expected response body.\n2. What is the `authInfoFactory` function used for?\n   - The `authInfoFactory` function is a factory function that creates an instance of the `AuthInfo` interface with the provided authorization token and default request and response values.\n3. What other modules or types are imported in this file?\n   - This file imports several modules and types from other files, including `apiRoutes`, `makeBearer`, and `ApiCall` from the parent directory, as well as the `User` type from the `types/user` file."
