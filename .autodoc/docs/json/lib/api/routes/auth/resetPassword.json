  "summary": "This code defines an interface and a factory function for making API calls to the `/auth/reset-password` endpoint of the kulturdaten-frontend project. \n\nThe `AuthResetPassword` interface extends the `ApiCall` interface and specifies the request and response types for this particular API call. The request type includes the HTTP method, headers, and body, while the response type includes the expected HTTP status code and response body. In this case, the response body includes a `meta` object with a `token` property that contains a bearer token for authentication.\n\nThe `authResetPasswordFactory` function is a factory function that returns an `AuthResetPassword` object with the appropriate request and response properties. It takes two arguments: a bearer token for authentication and a query object that includes the email and signature for the password reset request. The `route` property of the request object is generated using the `apiRoutes.authResetPassword` function, which takes the email and signature as parameters and returns the appropriate API route.\n\nThis code is used in the larger kulturdaten-frontend project to handle password reset requests from users. The `authResetPasswordFactory` function is called with the appropriate parameters to generate an `AuthResetPassword` object, which is then passed to the `ApiCall` function to make the actual API call. The bearer token is used to authenticate the request, and the email and signature are used to generate the appropriate API route. The response from the API call is then handled according to the expected response type specified in the `AuthResetPassword` interface.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines an interface and a factory function for making an API call to reset a user's password.\n\n2. What is the expected input for the `authResetPasswordFactory` function?\n   The `authResetPasswordFactory` function expects a token string and a query object with a `body` property that matches the `request.body` interface defined in the `AuthResetPassword` interface.\n\n3. What is the expected output of the `authResetPasswordFactory` function?\n   The `authResetPasswordFactory` function returns an object that matches the `AuthResetPassword` interface, with the `request` object populated with the provided token and query parameters, and the `response` object initialized with a `status` of 200 and an undefined `body`."
