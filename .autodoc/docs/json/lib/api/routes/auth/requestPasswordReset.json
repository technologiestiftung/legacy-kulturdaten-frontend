  "summary": "This code defines an interface and a factory function for making an API call to request a password reset for a user's account. The interface, `AuthRequestPasswordReset`, specifies the structure of the request and response objects for this API call. The factory function, `authRequestPasswordResetFactory`, takes in a user token and a query object containing the user's email address, and returns an object that conforms to the `AuthRequestPasswordReset` interface.\n\nThe `AuthRequestPasswordReset` interface specifies that the API call should be a POST request to the `/auth/login` endpoint with a JSON body containing the user's email address. The response should have a status code of 200 and a JSON body with a `meta` object containing a `token` field with a bearer token string, a `message` field with a success message string, and a `language` field with a language code string.\n\nThe `authRequestPasswordResetFactory` function takes in a user token and a query object containing the user's email address. It then returns an object with a `request` field containing the API call request object, and a `response` field containing the expected response object. The `request` object specifies the endpoint, method, headers, and body of the API call, while the `response` object specifies the expected status code and structure of the response.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to make an API call to request a password reset for a user's account. The `authRequestPasswordResetFactory` function can be imported and called with a user token and email address to generate an object that can be passed to a function that makes the actual API call. The response from the API call can then be checked against the expected structure defined in the `AuthRequestPasswordReset` interface.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines an interface and a factory function for making an API call to request a password reset for a user's account.\n\n2. What dependencies are required for this code to work?\n   This code imports several modules from a parent directory, including `apiRoutes`, `ApiCall`, `ApiRoute`, and `ApiCallFactory`.\n\n3. What is the expected response from the API call?\n   The expected response from the API call is a 200 status code and a JSON object with a `data` property set to `null`, a `meta` property containing a `token` object with a `type` of `'bearer'` and a `token` string, a `message` string, and a `language` string."
