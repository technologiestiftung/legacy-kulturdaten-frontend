  "summary": "The code defines an interface and a factory function for making API calls to delete a location. It imports several modules from the project's codebase, including `apiRoutes`, `makeBearer`, `ApiCall`, and `ApiRoute`. It also imports the `Location` type from the `types/location` module.\n\nThe `LocationDelete` interface extends the `ApiCall` interface and defines the shape of the request and response objects for a location deletion API call. The request object includes a `route` property that is generated using the `apiRoutes.locationDelete` function, which takes an `id` parameter and returns an `ApiRoute` object. The request also includes a `method` property set to `'DELETE'`, a `headers` object with an `Authorization` property set to a token generated using the `makeBearer` function, and a `body` property set to a `Location` object or `null`.\n\nThe response object includes a `status` property set to `200` and a `body` property with a `data` property set to `null` and a `meta` property with a `message` property set to `'Location deleted successfully'`.\n\nThe `locationDeleteFactory` function takes a `token` parameter and a `query` parameter with an `id` property and an `entry` property set to a `Location` object. It returns an object that conforms to the `LocationDelete` interface, with the `request` object populated using the `apiRoutes.locationDelete` function and the `headers` object populated using the `makeBearer` function. The `body` property is set to the `entry` object passed in the `query` parameter.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to make API calls to delete a location. The `locationDeleteFactory` function can be called with a token and a query object containing the ID of the location to be deleted and a `Location` object representing the location to be deleted. The resulting object can then be passed to a function that makes the API call and handles the response.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines an interface and a factory function for making API calls to delete a location using a DELETE request with authorization headers and a JSON body.\n\n2. What dependencies are required for this code to work?\n   This code imports several modules from the parent directory, including `apiRoutes`, `makeBearer`, `ApiCall`, and `ApiRoute`, as well as a `Location` type from a `types` directory.\n\n3. What is the expected response from the API call made by `locationDeleteFactory`?\n   The expected response is a 200 status code with a JSON body containing a `data` property set to `null` and a `meta` property with a `message` property set to `'Location deleted successfully'`."
