  "summary": "The code defines an API call for retrieving a list of offers from a backend server. It exports an interface `OfferList` that extends `ApiCall`, which specifies the request and response format of the API call. The request object contains the route, method, and headers of the HTTP request, while the response object specifies the expected HTTP status code and response body.\n\nThe `offerListFactory` function is an implementation of the `ApiCallFactory` interface, which takes a token and a query object as input and returns an instance of `OfferList`. The `token` parameter is used to set the `Authorization` header of the HTTP request, while the `query` parameter is used to construct the URL query parameters of the request.\n\nThis code is part of a larger project that provides a frontend interface for cultural data. The `OfferList` API call is used to retrieve a list of cultural offers from the backend server, which can be displayed to the user. The `offerListFactory` function is used to create instances of the `OfferList` API call with the appropriate token and query parameters.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```typescript\nimport { offerListFactory } from './path/to/offerList';\n\nconst token = 'my-auth-token';\nconst query = { category: 'music', date: '2022-01-01' };\n\nconst offerList = offerListFactory(token, query);\n\n// Send the API request and handle the response\nfetch(offerList.request.route, {\n  method: offerList.request.method,\n  headers: offerList.request.headers,\n})\n  .then((response) => {\n    if (response.status === offerList.response.status) {\n      return response.json();\n    } else {\n      throw new Error(`Unexpected status code: ${response.status}`);\n    }\n  })\n  .then((data) => {\n    console.log(data); // { data: [ ... ] }\n  })\n  .catch((error) => {\n    console.error(error);\n  });\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines an interface and a factory function for making API calls to retrieve a list of offers, with authentication headers.\n\n2. What dependencies are being imported?\n- The code imports `ParsedUrlQuery` from the `node:querystring` module, as well as several functions and types from other files in the project.\n\n3. What is the expected format of the response body?\n- The response body is expected to be an object with a `data` property, which is an array of `Offer` objects. The `body` property of the `response` object is initially set to `undefined`."
