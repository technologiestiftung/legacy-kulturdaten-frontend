  "summary": "The code defines an API call for retrieving a list of app tokens from a server. It exports an interface `AppTokenList` that extends `ApiCall`, which specifies the request and response format of the API call. The request object has a `route` property that is a function that returns the URL path for the API endpoint, and a `method` property that is set to `'GET'`. The `headers` property contains an `Authorization` field that is set to a bearer token generated from the `token` argument passed to the `appTokenListFactory` function, and a `Content-Type` field that is set to `'application/json'`.\n\nThe response object has a `status` property set to `200`, indicating a successful response, and a `body` property that is an object with a `meta` field containing an array of `AppToken` objects.\n\nThe `appTokenListFactory` function is an implementation of the `ApiCallFactory` interface, which takes a `token` argument and returns an `AppTokenList` object. It constructs the `request` object by calling the `apiRoutes.appToken()` function to get the URL path for the app token endpoint, and setting the `headers` field with the bearer token and content type. The `response` object is initialized with a `status` of `200` and an undefined `body`.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to make API calls to retrieve a list of app tokens from the server. The `appTokenListFactory` function can be called with a valid bearer token to create an `AppTokenList` object, which can then be passed to a function that sends the API request and handles the response. The `AppTokenList` interface can also be used to define the expected response format for type checking and validation.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `AppTokenList` interface?\n   - The `AppTokenList` interface defines the structure of an API call that retrieves a list of app tokens.\n2. What is the `appTokenListFactory` function used for?\n   - The `appTokenListFactory` function is a factory function that creates an instance of the `AppTokenList` interface with the provided authorization token.\n3. What is the expected response format for the `AppTokenList` API call?\n   - The expected response format for the `AppTokenList` API call is a JSON object with a `meta` property that contains an array of `AppToken` objects. The HTTP status code should be 200."
