  "summary": "This code defines an API call for retrieving a list of main offer types from the backend server. It exports an interface `OfferMainTypeList` that extends `ApiCall`, which defines the request and response types for the API call. The request type specifies that the method is `GET` and the headers include an `Authorization` token. The response type specifies that the status code is `200` and the body contains an array of `OfferType` objects.\n\nThe code also exports a factory function `offerMainTypeListFactory` that takes an `Authorization` token as input and returns an instance of `OfferMainTypeList`. The factory function constructs the request object by calling `apiRoutes.offerMainTypeList()` to get the URL for the API endpoint, and sets the `Authorization` header using the `makeBearer` function. The response object is initialized with a `status` of `200` and an undefined `body`.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to make API calls to retrieve a list of main offer types from the backend server. The `offerMainTypeListFactory` function can be called with a valid `Authorization` token to create an instance of `OfferMainTypeList`, which can then be passed to the `ApiCall` utility function to make the actual API call. The response from the server will contain an array of `OfferType` objects, which can be used to populate the UI or perform other operations in the frontend application.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { ApiCall } from '../..';\nimport { offerMainTypeListFactory, OfferMainTypeList } from './offerMainTypeList';\n\nconst token = 'my-auth-token';\n\nconst offerMainTypeList: OfferMainTypeList = offerMainTypeListFactory(token);\n\nApiCall(offerMainTypeList)\n  .then((response) => {\n    console.log(response.body.data); // array of OfferType objects\n  })\n  .catch((error) => {\n    console.error(error);\n  });\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `OfferType` type imported in this file?\n- The `OfferType` type is used in the `OfferMainTypeList` interface to define the shape of the `data` property in the response body.\n\n2. What is the `offerMainTypeListFactory` function used for?\n- The `offerMainTypeListFactory` function is an implementation of the `ApiCallFactory` interface that creates an `OfferMainTypeList` object with the appropriate request and response properties for making a GET request to the `apiRoutes.offerMainTypeList()` endpoint with a bearer token.\n\n3. Where are the `apiRoutes`, `ApiCall`, `ApiRoute`, and `ApiCallFactory` modules imported from?\n- These modules are imported from the parent directory (`../..`) of the current file."
