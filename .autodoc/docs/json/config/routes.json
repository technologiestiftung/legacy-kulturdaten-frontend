  "summary": "This file contains the routing information for the kulturdaten-frontend project. It defines all the routes present in the app as an enum called `Routes`, and provides functions for all valid routes returning relative paths. The `routes` object is a mapping of each route to its corresponding function. \n\nFor example, the `index` route is mapped to a function that takes a `locale` parameter and returns the localized path for the index page. The `dashboard` route takes a `query` and `locale` parameter and returns the localized path for the dashboard page with the organizer's name included in the path. \n\nThe `internalRoutes` array contains all the routes that are considered internal to the app and are not accessible to the public. \n\nThe `localizedRoutes` object contains the localized parts for all route paths. Each route is mapped to an object that contains the localized path for each supported locale. \n\nThe `routesLayouts` object maps each route to its corresponding layout. The `Layouts` enum contains the different layout options for the app. \n\nThis file is used throughout the project to generate links and paths for different pages and components. For example, the `routes` object is used in the `Link` component to generate links to different pages. The `routesLayouts` object is used to determine the layout for each page. \n\nOverall, this file provides a centralized location for all routing information in the app, making it easier to manage and update the routing logic.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `routes` object?\n   - The `routes` object contains functions for all valid routes in the app, returning relative paths based on the provided parameters.\n2. What is the `internalRoutes` array used for?\n   - The `internalRoutes` array contains all valid routes that are considered internal to the app, and is likely used for internal routing and navigation purposes.\n3. What is the `routesLayouts` object used for?\n   - The `routesLayouts` object maps each route to a specific layout component, indicating which layout should be used for each route."
