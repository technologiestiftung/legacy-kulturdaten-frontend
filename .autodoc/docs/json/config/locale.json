  "summary": "This code defines two enums, `Locale` and `Language`, and a constant `defaultLanguage`. \n\nThe `Locale` enum lists all the locales that are used in the app, with their values being the same as their keys. The two locales listed are `de-DE` and `en-DE`. \n\nThe `Language` enum lists the languages used in the app, with their values being the same as their keys. The two languages listed are `de` and `en`. \n\nThe `defaultLanguage` constant is set to `de`, which is the default language for the app. \n\nThese enums and constant are likely used throughout the app to handle localization and language settings. For example, the `Locale` enum may be used to determine which language-specific content to display based on the user's locale. The `Language` enum may be used to set the language of the app interface. The `defaultLanguage` constant may be used as a fallback language if the user's preferred language is not available. \n\nHere is an example of how these enums and constant may be used in code:\n\n```\nimport { Locale, Language, defaultLanguage } from './localization';\n\n// Get the user's preferred locale\nconst userLocale = navigator.language;\n\n// Determine which language-specific content to display based on the user's locale\nlet content;\nif (userLocale === Locale['de-DE']) {\n  content = {\n    title: 'Willkommen',\n    message: 'Diese Seite ist auf Deutsch.',\n  };\n} else if (userLocale === Locale['en-DE']) {\n  content = {\n    title: 'Welcome',\n    message: 'This page is in English.',\n  };\n} else {\n  // Fallback to default language if user's locale is not supported\n  content = {\n    title: 'Willkommen',\n    message: 'Diese Seite ist auf Deutsch.',\n  };\n}\n\n// Set the language of the app interface\nconst appLanguage = localStorage.getItem('appLanguage') || defaultLanguage;\n\nif (appLanguage === Language.de) {\n  // Set app interface to German\n} else if (appLanguage === Language.en) {\n  // Set app interface to English\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `Locale` and `Language` enums?** The `Locale` enum lists all the locales used in the app, while the `Language` enum lists the languages. They are likely used for localization and internationalization purposes.\n2. **Why is the default language set to `Language.de`?** The default language is set to German (`de`) because the project is primarily targeted towards German speakers.\n3. **Are there any other language options available besides German and English?** No, the only language options available are German (`de`) and English (`en`)."
