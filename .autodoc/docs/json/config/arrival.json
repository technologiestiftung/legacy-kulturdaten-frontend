  "summary": "The code defines an array of objects that represent a form category for providing information about how to get to a location. The category is called \"locationArrival\" and contains two subcategories: \"By bicycle / car\" and \"By public transportation\". Each subcategory contains a set of form fields that collect information about parking, public transport stops, and line numbers for different modes of public transport.\n\nThe form fields are defined using the \"GenericFormFieldType\" enum, which specifies the type of input that should be used for each field. The available types are \"checkboxList\" and \"input\", which respectively represent a list of checkboxes and a text input field. The form fields also have translations for different languages, which are defined using the \"Language\" enum and the \"translations\" property.\n\nThe form data is stored in an object with nested keys that correspond to the different form fields. For example, the parking options are stored under the \"services.parking\" key, and the public transport stop name is stored under the \"services.publicTransport\" key. The form data can be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript, and can be submitted to a server for processing.\n\nThis code is used in the larger project to provide a user-friendly interface for collecting information about how to get to different cultural locations. The form data is used to generate maps and directions for users, and can also be used to analyze transportation patterns and improve accessibility. The code can be extended and customized to support additional form fields and languages, and can be integrated with other parts of the project to provide a seamless user experience.",
