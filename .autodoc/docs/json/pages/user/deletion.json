  "summary": "The code above is a Next.js page component that renders a user deletion page. It imports the `NextPage` component from the `next` package, which is used to define a Next.js page. It also imports the `UserDeletionPage` component from the `../../components/pages/user/deletion` file, which is the actual content of the page. Additionally, it imports the `AppWrapper` component from the `../../components/wrappers/AppWrapper` file, which is a higher-order component that wraps the `UserDeletionPage` component and provides some common functionality, such as a header and footer.\n\nThe `DeletionPage` component is defined as a function that returns a JSX element. It uses the `AppWrapper` component to wrap the `UserDeletionPage` component, which is rendered inside it. The purpose of this component is to provide a consistent layout and styling for the user deletion page, as well as any other pages that use the `AppWrapper` component.\n\nThis code is part of the larger `kulturdaten-frontend` project, which is a web application for cultural data management. The `DeletionPage` component is just one of many pages in the application, and it is used to allow users to delete their accounts. By using the `AppWrapper` component, the page has a consistent look and feel with the rest of the application, which improves the user experience.\n\nHere is an example of how this component might be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nimport DeletionPage from '../pages/user/deletion';\n\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <header>...</header>\n      <main>\n        <DeletionPage />\n      </main>\n      <footer>...</footer>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `DeletionPage` component is imported and rendered inside the `App` component, which is the main entry point for the application. The `App` component provides a header and footer, and the `DeletionPage` component is wrapped in the `AppWrapper` component, which provides additional layout and styling.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `NextPage` import?\n   - The `NextPage` import is used to define the type of the `DeletionPage` component as a Next.js page component.\n\n2. What is the `UserDeletionPage` component?\n   - The `UserDeletionPage` component is a custom component located in the `components/pages/user/deletion` directory that is being rendered within the `DeletionPage` component.\n\n3. What is the `AppWrapper` component?\n   - The `AppWrapper` component is a custom wrapper component located in the `components/wrappers` directory that is being used to wrap the `UserDeletionPage` component and provide common layout and functionality to the page."
