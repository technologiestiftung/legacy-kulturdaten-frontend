  "summary": "The code above is a Next.js page component that renders the RequestPasswordResetPageComponent from the components/pages/auth/ResetPassword file. The purpose of this code is to provide a route for the user to request a password reset. \n\nThe NextPage import is used to define the type of the component as a Next.js page. The RequestPasswordResetPageComponent is imported from the components/pages/auth/ResetPassword file and is rendered within the RequestPasswordResetPage component. \n\nThis code is part of the larger kulturdaten-frontend project and is used to provide a user interface for requesting a password reset. The component can be used in conjunction with other components and pages to create a complete user authentication system. \n\nHere is an example of how this component might be used in a larger project:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport RequestPasswordResetPage from './pages/auth/RequestPasswordResetPage';\nimport LoginPage from './pages/auth/LoginPage';\n\nconst App: React.FC = () => {\n  const [loggedIn, setLoggedIn] = React.useState(false);\n\n  const handleLogin = () => {\n    setLoggedIn(true);\n  };\n\n  const handleLogout = () => {\n    setLoggedIn(false);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {loggedIn ? (\n        <div>\n          <h1>Welcome!</h1>\n          <button onClick={handleLogout}>Logout</button>\n        </div>\n      ) : (\n        <div>\n          <LoginPage onLogin={handleLogin} />\n          <RequestPasswordResetPage />\n        </div>\n      )}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nIn this example, the RequestPasswordResetPage component is used alongside the LoginPage component to provide a complete authentication system. The user can either log in or request a password reset. If the user is logged in, they will see a welcome message and a logout button. If the user is not logged in, they will see the login and password reset pages. \n\nOverall, the RequestPasswordResetPage component is a small but important part of the larger kulturdaten-frontend project. It provides a simple and intuitive way for users to request a password reset and can be used in conjunction with other components to create a complete authentication system.",
