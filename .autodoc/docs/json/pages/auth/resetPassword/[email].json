  "summary": "The code above is a Next.js page component that renders the ResetPasswordPageComponent from the project's components directory. The purpose of this code is to provide a route for the user to reset their password. \n\nThe NextPage import is used to define the type of the ResetPasswordPage component. Next.js is a React framework that provides server-side rendering and other features to improve the performance and SEO of web applications. \n\nThe ResetPasswordPage component is a functional component that returns the ResetPasswordPageComponent. This component is responsible for rendering the UI for the password reset page. \n\nThis code is part of the larger kulturdaten-frontend project, which is a web application for cultural data management. The ResetPasswordPage component is likely used in conjunction with other components and pages to provide a complete user authentication and password management system. \n\nHere is an example of how this component might be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nimport { Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport ResetPasswordPage from './pages/auth/ResetPasswordPage';\n\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n    <Router>\n      <Switch>\n        <Route path=\"/reset-password\" component={ResetPasswordPage} />\n        {/* other routes */}\n      </Switch>\n    </Router>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the ResetPasswordPage component is imported and used as a route in the React Router. When the user navigates to the \"/reset-password\" path, the ResetPasswordPage component will be rendered, allowing the user to reset their password.",
