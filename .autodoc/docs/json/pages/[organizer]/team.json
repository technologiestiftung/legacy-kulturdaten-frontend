  "summary": "The code above is a React component that renders the Organizer Team page of the Kulturdaten Frontend project. The purpose of this component is to provide a wrapper for the Organizer Team page and to pass the necessary props to it.\n\nThe component imports the NextPage component from the Next.js library, which is used to define a page in a Next.js application. It also imports the useRouter hook from Next.js, which provides access to the router object, and the AppWrapper component from the project's components/wrappers directory, which is a higher-order component that provides a layout for the page.\n\nThe component also imports the useCategories hook from the project's config/categories directory, which is used to retrieve the category object for the Organizer category. The category object contains information about the category, such as its name, slug, and sub-menu key.\n\nThe component then defines a functional component called TeamPage, which is a Next.js page component. The component uses the useRouter hook to retrieve the router object, which contains information about the current route, including the query parameters. It also uses the useCategories hook to retrieve the category object for the Organizer category.\n\nIf the category object exists, the component returns the AppWrapper component with the subMenuKey prop set to the sub-menu key of the Organizer category. The OrganizerTeamPage component is then rendered inside the AppWrapper component with the category and query props passed to it.\n\nIf the category object does not exist, the component returns null.\n\nOverall, this component is an important part of the Kulturdaten Frontend project as it provides a wrapper for the Organizer Team page and ensures that the necessary props are passed to it. It also demonstrates the use of Next.js page components, hooks, and higher-order components in the project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n   - This code file defines a React component for the team page of the organizer section of a website, wrapped in an AppWrapper component.\n\n2. What is the role of the useCategories hook?\n   - The useCategories hook is used to retrieve the categories configuration object, which contains information about the different sections of the website, including the organizer section.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the conditional statement in the component?\n   - The conditional statement checks if the category object exists, and if so, renders the OrganizerTeamPage component wrapped in the AppWrapper component with the subMenuKey property set to the subMenuKey of the organizer category. If the category object does not exist, it returns null."
