The code is defining two functions, `renderDocs` and `unmountDocs`, which are used to render and unmount documentation for a selected story in a Storybook instance. 

The `renderDocs` function takes in four parameters: `story`, `docsContext`, `element`, and `callback`. `story` is an object that represents the selected story, `docsContext` is an object that contains context information for the documentation, `element` is the DOM element where the documentation will be rendered, and `callback` is a function that will be called after the documentation is rendered. The function returns a promise that resolves when the documentation is rendered.

The `unmountDocs` function takes in one parameter, `element`, which is the DOM element where the documentation is currently rendered. The function unmounts the documentation from the DOM.

The code also defines a component called `NoDocs_NoDocs`, which is used to display a message when there is no documentation available for the selected story. The component is rendered using the `renderDocs` function.

Overall, these functions are used to provide documentation for the selected story in a Storybook instance. The `renderDocs` function is called when the user selects a story, and the documentation is rendered in the specified DOM element. The `unmountDocs` function is called when the user navigates away from the selected story, and the documentation is removed from the DOM. The `NoDocs_NoDocs` component is used to display a message when there is no documentation available for the selected story.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code exports two functions, `renderDocs` and `unmountDocs`, which are used for rendering and unmounting documentation for a selected story in Storybook.

2. What dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses several dependencies, including `regenerator-runtime`, `core-js`, `react`, and `react-dom`.

3. What is the error message that can be thrown if `docs.container` is not set?
- The error message that can be thrown if `docs.container` is not set is "No `docs.container` set, did you run `addon-docs/preset`?" This suggests that the `addon-docs` preset needs to be installed and configured in order to use this code.
