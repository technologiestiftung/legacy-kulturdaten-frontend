The code defines the layout of the main application page for the Kulturdaten-frontend project. It imports various components from other files and libraries, including `useBodyLock` and `useActiveRoute` from the `lib` folder, `NavigationProps` and `useNavigationOverlayVisible` from the `navigation` folder, and `mq` and `overlayStyles` from the `globals` folder. 

The `AppLayout` component is the main component in this file, which takes in `header`, `sidebar`, `content`, and `layout` as props. It renders the header, sidebar, and content in their respective slots, and applies CSS styles to position them on the page. The `layout` prop determines whether the page should have an organizer band (a vertical navigation bar on the left side of the page), which is used for logged-in users. 

The `useLayout` function returns the layout type based on the active route, which is determined by the `useActiveRoute` hook. The `appLayouts` object defines the layout types and whether they have an organizer band. 

The `Container` component defines the grid layout of the page, with 4 columns for small screens, 11 columns for medium screens, and 8 columns for large screens. The `OrganizerSlot` component defines the position and style of the organizer band, which is fixed to the left side of the page and has a black background when the user is in admin mode. The `HeaderSlot` and `HeaderSlotSecondary` components define the position and style of the header, with `HeaderSlotSecondary` being used for the secondary header. The `MenuSlot` component defines the position and style of the sidebar, which is fixed to the left side of the page and expands when the user clicks on the menu button. The `ContentSlot` component defines the position and style of the content, which takes up the remaining space on the page. 

The `useEffect` hooks are used to set the `inert` attribute on the `ContentSlot` when the main menu overlay is visible, which prevents the content from being focusable via tabbing. Another `useEffect` hook sets the `role` attribute on the `__next` element to `application`. 

Overall, this code defines the layout of the main application page for the Kulturdaten-frontend project, with components for the header, sidebar, content, and organizer band. It uses CSS grid to position the components on the page and applies styles to make the page responsive to different screen sizes.
