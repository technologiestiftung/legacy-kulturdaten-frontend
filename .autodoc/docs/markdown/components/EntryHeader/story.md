The code defines a Storybook story for the EntryHeader component, which is used in the Kulturdaten Frontend project. The EntryHeader component is a reusable UI component that displays a header for an entry in the Kulturdaten database. The header includes a title, a back button, a dropdown menu, and a set of tabs.

The code imports the EntryHeader component, as well as several other components and utilities from the project's codebase. These include the Button, DropdownMenu, and Tabs components, as well as the useT hook for internationalization.

The code defines a testTabLinks array, which contains an array of objects representing the links for the tabs in the header. Each object has a title, href, and isActive property. The isActive property is used to indicate which tab is currently active.

The code defines a Storybook story called EntryHeaderDefaultStory, which renders an instance of the EntryHeader component with some sample props. The props include a back button, a dropdown menu, a title, and a set of tabs. The back button is a Button component with an ArrowLeft icon and the text "zur√ºck". The dropdown menu is a DropdownMenu component with three Button components inside. The title is a string, and the tabs are rendered using the Tabs component with the testTabLinks array as its links prop.

The purpose of this code is to provide a visual representation of the EntryHeader component in Storybook, which allows developers to see how the component looks and behaves in different scenarios. By defining a Storybook story for the component, developers can easily test and iterate on the component's design and functionality without having to navigate to the actual application. The testTabLinks array and other sample props are used to demonstrate the different ways in which the component can be configured and customized.
