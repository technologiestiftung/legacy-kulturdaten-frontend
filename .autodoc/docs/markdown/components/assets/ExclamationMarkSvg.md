The code above exports a React functional component called `ExclamationMarkSvg`. This component renders an SVG image of an exclamation mark. The SVG image has a width and height of 36 pixels and a viewBox of 0 0 36 36. The `fill` attribute is set to "none" and the `stroke` attribute is set to "currentColor", which means that the stroke color will be inherited from the parent element's color. The `strokeWidth` attribute is set to 2 and the `strokeLinecap` and `strokeLinejoin` attributes are set to "round", which means that the stroke will have rounded ends and corners.

The SVG image consists of two `path` elements. The first `path` element has a `d` attribute that defines a vertical line from the point (18,12) to the point (18,18). The `stroke` attribute is set to "currentColor", the `strokeWidth` attribute is set to 3, and the `strokeLinecap` and `strokeLinejoin` attributes are set to "round".

The second `path` element has a `d` attribute that defines a horizontal line from the point (18,24) to the point (18.0075,24). The `stroke` attribute, `strokeWidth` attribute, `strokeLinecap` attribute, and `strokeLinejoin` attribute are set to the same values as the first `path` element.

This component can be used in other components or pages of the project to display an exclamation mark icon. For example, it could be used in a form validation message to indicate that a field is required or in an error message to indicate that an error has occurred. The component can be imported and used like any other React component:

```
import { ExclamationMarkSvg } from './path/to/ExclamationMarkSvg';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Error</h2>
      <p>There was an error submitting your form. Please try again.</p>
      <ExclamationMarkSvg />
    </div>
  );
};
```
