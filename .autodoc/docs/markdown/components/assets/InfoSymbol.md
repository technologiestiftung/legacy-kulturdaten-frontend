The code above defines a React component called `InfoSymbol` that renders an information icon. The icon is styled using the `StyledInfoSymbol` component from the `@emotion/styled` library. The icon is a blue circle with a white "i" in the center. The component takes an optional `ariaLabel` prop, which is used to provide an accessible label for the icon. If the `ariaLabel` prop is not provided, the component uses a default label obtained from the `useT` hook, which is used for internationalization.

This component is likely used in the larger project to provide a consistent and accessible way to display information icons throughout the user interface. By using a separate component for the icon, the project can ensure that the icon is styled consistently and that accessibility concerns are addressed. The `InfoSymbol` component can be used in other components by importing it and rendering it as a child component. For example:

```
import { InfoSymbol } from './InfoSymbol';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>This is some text that needs an info icon <InfoSymbol /></p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Overall, this code demonstrates the use of styled components and the `useT` hook for internationalization in a React project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useT` function imported from `../../lib/i18n`?
   - The `useT` function is used for internationalization and localization purposes.
2. What is the significance of the `InfoISvg` component imported from `../assets/InfoISvg`?
   - The `InfoISvg` component likely renders an SVG icon or image that represents information or help.
3. What is the purpose of the `ariaLabel` prop in the `InfoSymbol` component?
   - The `ariaLabel` prop is used to provide an accessible label for the `StyledInfoSymbol` div, which contains the `InfoISvg` component. If the prop is not provided, the label is retrieved from the translation file using the `useT` function.
