The code above exports a React functional component called `CheckSvg`. This component renders an SVG image of a checkmark. The SVG image is defined using the SVG markup language and includes a path element that defines the shape of the checkmark.

The `CheckSvg` component takes no props and simply returns the SVG image. It is likely used in other components throughout the `kulturdaten-frontend` project to display a checkmark icon in various contexts.

Here is an example of how the `CheckSvg` component might be used in another component:

```
import React from 'react';
import { CheckSvg } from './CheckSvg';

const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Success!</h2>
      <p>Your submission was successful.</p>
      <CheckSvg />
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, the `CheckSvg` component is imported and rendered within the `MyComponent` component. The checkmark icon is displayed alongside a success message to indicate that the user's submission was successful.

Overall, the `CheckSvg` component is a simple and reusable component that provides a consistent way to display a checkmark icon throughout the `kulturdaten-frontend` project.
