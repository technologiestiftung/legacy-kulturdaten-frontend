The code above exports a React functional component called `ArrowRightSvg`. This component renders an SVG image of an arrow pointing to the right. The arrow is composed of two paths, both of which have a stroke color of "currentColor" and a stroke width of 2. The `viewBox` attribute defines the coordinate system for the SVG image, and the `width` and `height` attributes set the dimensions of the image.

This component can be used in other parts of the project where an arrow pointing to the right is needed. For example, it could be used as an icon for a button that navigates to the next page or as a visual indicator for a step in a multi-step process.

To use this component in another file, it can be imported like this:

```
import { ArrowRightSvg } from './path/to/ArrowRightSvg';
```

Then, it can be used in JSX like any other React component:

```
<button>
  Next
  <ArrowRightSvg />
</button>
```

This will render a button with the text "Next" and an arrow pointing to the right next to it.

Overall, this code provides a reusable component for rendering an arrow pointing to the right in a React application.
