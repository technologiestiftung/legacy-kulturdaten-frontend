The code defines a set of styled components that are used to create an authentication form wrapper for the kulturdaten-frontend project. The `StyledAuthWrapper` component is a grid container that has two columns on larger screens and one column on smaller screens. The first column contains the authentication form content, while the second column contains an image that is used as a background. The `StyledAuthWrapperContent` component is an empty container that is used to hold the authentication form content. The `StyledAuthWrapperImage` component is a container that holds the image used as a background. The `StyledAuthWrapperImageInner` component is an inner container that holds the actual image.

The `AuthFormContainer` component is a flex container that holds the authentication form elements. The `AuthFormItem` component is a flex container that holds a form item and its label. The `AuthHead` component is a flex container that holds the authentication form header. The `AuthHeadline` component is a styled `h1` element that displays the authentication form headline. The `AuthSubline` component is a styled `h2` element that displays the authentication form subline. The `AuthContent` component is a container that holds the authentication form content.

The `AuthWrapper` component is a wrapper that holds the authentication form content and the background image. It takes two props: `children`, which is the authentication form content, and `image`, which is an object that contains the image source and credits. The `AuthWrapper` component renders the `StyledAuthWrapper` component, which contains the `StyledAuthWrapperContent` and `StyledAuthWrapperImage` components. The `StyledAuthWrapperContent` component renders the authentication form content, while the `StyledAuthWrapperImage` component renders the background image.

Overall, these styled components are used to create a visually appealing and responsive authentication form wrapper for the kulturdaten-frontend project. The components can be used in other parts of the project that require a similar layout and styling.
