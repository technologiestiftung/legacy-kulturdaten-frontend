The code defines a login form component for the Kulturdaten-frontend project. The component is built using React and Next.js and is used to authenticate users. 

The component imports several other components and functions from the project's codebase, including `useRouter` and `useEffect` from Next.js, `useApiCall` and `authLoginFactory` from the `lib/api` module, and `useUser` from the `user/useUser` module. 

The component defines several state variables using the `useState` hook, including `email`, `password`, `error`, and `remember`. It also defines several constants using the `useRef` and `useMemo` hooks, including `formRef` and `redirect`. 

The component defines a `submitHandler` function that is called when the login form is submitted. The function first checks if the form is valid, and if so, it calls the `authLoginFactory` function to authenticate the user. If the authentication is successful, the function sets an authentication cookie using the `authCookie` function and redirects the user to the dashboard. If the authentication fails, the function sets an error message using the `setError` function. 

The component defines a `form` variable that contains the login form HTML. The form contains several input fields, including an email input, a password input, and a checkbox for remembering the user's login. The form also contains a submit button and a link to reset the user's password. 

Overall, the `LoginForm` component is a key part of the Kulturdaten-frontend project's authentication system. It allows users to log in to the site and access protected content. The component is designed to be reusable and can be easily integrated into other parts of the project.
## Questions:

2. What external libraries or APIs does this code use?
- This code uses the `next/router`, `react`, and `next/config` libraries, as well as custom libraries and APIs defined in the project.
