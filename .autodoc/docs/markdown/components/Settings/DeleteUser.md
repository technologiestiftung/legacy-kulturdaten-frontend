The `DeleteUser` component is a React functional component that provides a form for users to request the deletion of their account. It imports several modules from the project's `lib` and `components` directories, including `useApiCall`, `userUpdateFactory`, `useT`, `Button`, `useConfirmScreen`, `EntryFormHead`, `StyledEntryFormContainer`, `FormGrid`, `FormItem`, `FormItemWidth`, and `useUser`.

The component first retrieves the current user's information and the `useConfirmScreen` hook, which displays a confirmation dialog when the user clicks the deletion button. It then renders a form with a title, a message explaining the consequences of account deletion, and a button to initiate the deletion process.

When the user clicks the deletion button, the `confirmScreen` function is called with an object containing the confirmation dialog's properties. If the user confirms the deletion, an API call is made to update the user's account with a `deletionRequestedAt` attribute set to the current date and time. If the API call is successful, the `mutateUserInfo` function is called to update the user's information, and a success message is returned. If the API call fails, an error message is returned.

Overall, the `DeleteUser` component provides a simple and user-friendly way for users to request the deletion of their account. It leverages several reusable components and hooks from the project's `lib` and `components` directories to implement the deletion process.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code exports a React functional component called `DeleteUser` that displays a form for deleting a user account. It uses various imported components and functions to handle API calls, user authentication, and confirmation screens.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several imported modules, including `useApiCall` and `userUpdateFactory` from `../../lib/api`, `useT` from `../../lib/i18n`, `Button` and `ButtonSize` from `../button`, `useConfirmScreen` from `../Confirm/ConfirmScreen`, `EntryFormHead` from `../EntryForm/EntryFormHead`, `StyledEntryFormContainer` from `../EntryForm/wrappers`, `FormGrid`, `FormItem`, and `FormItemWidth` from `../pages/helpers/formComponents`, and `useUser` from `../user/useUser`.

3. What is the purpose of the `confirmScreen` function and how is it used?
- The `confirmScreen` function is imported from `../Confirm/ConfirmScreen` and is used to display a confirmation dialog when the user clicks the delete button. It takes an object with various properties, including `title`, `message`, `confirmText`, `onConfirm`, and `condition`, and returns a promise that resolves with the user's confirmation choice. In this code, it is called with an object that includes the confirmation message, the user's email address, and a callback function that sends a deletion request to the server.
