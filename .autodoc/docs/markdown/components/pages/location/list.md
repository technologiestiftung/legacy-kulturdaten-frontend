The `LocationListPage` component is a React functional component that renders a list of locations based on the user's selected filters and sorting options. The component is part of the larger `kulturdaten-frontend` project and imports various modules from the project's `config`, `lib`, and `components` directories.

The component uses the `useRouter` hook from the `next/router` module to access the current route and the `useContext` hook to access the `EntryListContext` context, which provides information about the current list of entries being displayed. The component also uses various other hooks, such as `useMemo`, `useState`, and `useEffect`, to manage state and perform side effects.

The `LocationListPage` component renders a `LocationList` component from the `components/EntryList` directory, which displays a list of locations based on the data returned from the `useList` hook. The `useList` hook takes several arguments, including the current page, number of entries per page, filters, and sorting options, and returns a paginated list of locations based on those parameters.

The component also uses the `useBreakpointOrWider` hook from the `lib/WindowService` module to determine whether the user's screen size is mid-sized or wider. If the screen size is mid-sized or wider and the list of locations is not empty, the component uses the `router.replace` method to navigate to the details page for the first location in the list. Otherwise, the component renders the `LocationList` component with the `expanded` prop set to `false`.

Overall, the `LocationListPage` component provides a way for users to view and filter a list of locations and navigate to the details page for each location. It is a key part of the `kulturdaten-frontend` project's user interface and data management system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a React functional component for rendering a page that displays a list of locations.

2. What external libraries or APIs does this code file use?
- This code file imports several modules from the project's own codebase, as well as from the Next.js and React libraries.
- It also imports types and functions from an external API module located in the project's `lib` directory.

3. What is the significance of the `useMemo` hook in this code file?
- The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the results of certain function calls, such as `getFilters` and `getSortKey`, so that they are only recomputed when their dependencies change. This can help improve performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
