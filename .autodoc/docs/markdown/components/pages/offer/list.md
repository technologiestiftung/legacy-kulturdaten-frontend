The `OfferListPage` component is a React functional component that renders a list of offers based on the current category page. It imports various hooks and components from different files in the project to achieve this functionality.

The component first imports the `useRouter` hook from the `next/router` module, which is used to access the current route and query parameters. It also imports the `useContext` hook from React, which is used to access the `EntryListContext` object, which contains information about the current list of entries being displayed.

The component then imports various other hooks and components from different files in the project, such as `useCategories` from `../../../config/categories`, `OfferList` from `../../EntryList/OfferList`, and `AppWrapper` from `../../wrappers/AppWrapper`.

The `OfferListPage` component uses the `useList` hook to fetch the list of offers based on the current category page and other parameters such as the current page number, number of entries per page, sorting key, and filters. It also uses the `useOrganizerId` hook to get the current organizer ID, which is used as a filter parameter when fetching the list of offers.

The component then uses the `useEffect` hook to update the route and query parameters based on the current list of offers when the component mounts or when the list of offers changes. If the screen size is mid or wider and the list of offers is not empty, the component updates the route and query parameters to display the details of the last viewed offer or the first offer in the list. The `setListEvaluated` function is used to indicate that the list has been evaluated and can be displayed.

Finally, the component returns the `OfferList` component wrapped in the `AppWrapper` component if the list has been evaluated and the screen size is not mid or wider. Otherwise, it returns an empty string.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines a React functional component for rendering a page that displays a list of offers.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code file imports several modules from external libraries, including `next/router`, `react`, and `react-dom`.

3. What is the significance of the `useMemo` hook in this code?
- The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the results of certain function calls, such as `getFilters`, `getCurrentPage`, and `getSortKey`, so that they are only re-evaluated when their dependencies change. This can help improve performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
