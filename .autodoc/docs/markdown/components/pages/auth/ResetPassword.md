The code above defines two React functional components, `ResetPasswordPage` and `RequestPasswordResetPage`, that are used to render the reset password and request password reset pages respectively in the Kulturdaten-frontend project. 

Both components use the `AuthWrapper` component from the `../../auth/AuthWrapper` module to provide a consistent layout and styling for the pages. The `AuthWrapper` component takes an image prop that is used as the background image for the page. In this case, the `resetPasswordImage` imported from `../../../public/img/heye-jensen-uVIpeJE9X9c-unsplash.jpg` is used as the background image for both pages.

The `ResetPasswordPage` component renders the `ResetPasswordForm` component from the `../../auth/ResetPassword` module. This form is used to allow users to reset their password by entering their email address and a new password.

The `RequestPasswordResetPage` component renders the `RequestPasswordResetForm` component from the `../../auth/RequestPasswordReset` module. This form is used to allow users to request a password reset by entering their email address.

Overall, these components provide a user-friendly interface for resetting and requesting password resets in the Kulturdaten-frontend project. They are used in conjunction with other authentication-related components and modules to provide a secure and seamless user experience. 

Example usage:

```jsx
import { ResetPasswordPage, RequestPasswordResetPage } from './authPages';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ResetPasswordPage />
      <RequestPasswordResetPage />
    </div>
  );
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AuthWrapper` component?
- The `AuthWrapper` component is used to wrap the `ResetPasswordForm` and `RequestPasswordResetForm` components and provide a consistent layout and styling for authentication-related pages.

2. Where is the `resetPasswordImage` imported from?
- The `resetPasswordImage` is imported from the `public/img` directory and is likely an image used as a background for the authentication pages.

3. What is the difference between the `ResetPasswordPage` and `RequestPasswordResetPage` components?
- The `ResetPasswordPage` component renders the `ResetPasswordForm` component, which allows a user to reset their password. The `RequestPasswordResetPage` component renders the `RequestPasswordResetForm` component, which allows a user to request a password reset email.
