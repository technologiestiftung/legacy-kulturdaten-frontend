The code defines two custom hooks, `useMediaUploadForm` and `useMediaForm`, which are used to handle media uploads and updates in the larger project. 

`useMediaUploadForm` is used to upload media files to the server. It takes in four arguments: `category`, `query`, `disabled`, `maxFiles`, and `maxFileSizeInKb`. `category` and `query` are used to fetch the current entry data from the server. `disabled` is a boolean value that determines whether the upload functionality is disabled. `maxFiles` is the maximum number of files that can be uploaded, and `maxFileSizeInKb` is the maximum size of each file in kilobytes. The hook returns an object with a `renderedForm` property, which is a JSX element containing a `DropZone` component and an `Info` component. The `DropZone` component is used to drag and drop files for upload, while the `Info` component displays any errors that occur during the upload process.

`useMediaForm` is used to handle media updates. It takes in an object with two properties, `category` and `query`, which are used to fetch the current entry data from the server. The hook returns an object with four properties: `renderedForm`, `pristine`, `submit`, and `valid`. `renderedForm` is a JSX element containing a `MediaList` component and a `DropZone` component. The `MediaList` component displays a list of uploaded media files, while the `DropZone` component is used to upload new media files. `pristine` is a boolean value that determines whether the form has been modified. `submit` is a function that is called when the form is submitted, and `valid` is a boolean value that determines whether the form is valid.

Overall, these hooks are used to handle media uploads and updates in the larger project, and provide a convenient way to manage media files in the application.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useMediaUploadForm` function?
- The `useMediaUploadForm` function is used to handle the uploading of media files for a specific category and query, and returns a rendered form, as well as information about its validity and whether it has been modified.

2. What is the significance of the `mediaNotPristineList` state variable?
- The `mediaNotPristineList` state variable is used to keep track of which media items have been modified by the user, and is used to determine which media items need to be updated when the form is submitted.

3. What is the purpose of the `submitMediaList` function?
- The `submitMediaList` function is used to update any media items that have been modified by the user, by making API calls to update their attributes. It is called when the form is submitted.
