The code defines a set of styled React components for displaying and managing filters in the Kulturdaten-frontend project. The main component is `EntryListFiltersBox`, which takes in several props including `expanded`, `children`, `activeFiltersCount`, `isCollapsed`, `setIsCollapsed`, and `noPadding`. 

The `StyledFilters` component is a container for the filters and is styled to display the filters in a column or row depending on whether `expanded` is true or false. The `StyledFiltersBox` component is a container for each individual filter box and is styled to display a border and padding. The `StyledFiltersBoxTitle` component is a container for the title of each filter box and is styled to display a border, font weight, font size, line height, and padding. The `StyledFiltersBoxTitleButton` component is a button that toggles the visibility of the filter box and is styled to display a border, padding, font size, line height, font weight, and cursor. The `StyledFiltersBoxChildren` component is a container for the children of each filter box and is styled to display a border and flex direction.

The `EntryListFiltersBox` component is the main component that renders the filter boxes. It takes in the `expanded` prop, which determines whether the filter boxes are displayed in a column or row. It also takes in the `children` prop, which is an array of filter components. The `activeFiltersCount` prop is used to display the number of active filters. The `isCollapsed` prop is used to determine whether the filter box is collapsed or expanded. The `setIsCollapsed` prop is a function that sets the value of `isCollapsed`. The `noPadding` prop is used to determine whether the filter box has padding.

The `useCollapsable` hook is used to toggle the visibility of the filter box when the `StyledFiltersBoxTitleButton` is clicked. It takes in the `renderedChildren`, `isCollapsed`, and `setIsCollapsed` props and returns the `renderedCollapsable` component.

Overall, this code provides a set of reusable styled components for displaying and managing filters in the Kulturdaten-frontend project. The `EntryListFiltersBox` component can be used to render filter boxes with customizable props, and the `useCollapsable` hook can be used to toggle the visibility of the filter boxes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EntryListFiltersBox` component?
- The `EntryListFiltersBox` component is a filter box that can be expanded or collapsed, and it contains child components that are rendered conditionally based on its state.

2. What is the role of the `useCollapsable` hook?
- The `useCollapsable` hook is used to manage the state of the collapsible child components within the `EntryListFiltersBox` component, and it returns the rendered child components along with a function to toggle the collapsed state.

3. What is the purpose of the `mq` function and the `Breakpoint` enum?
- The `mq` function is used to define media queries for responsive design, and the `Breakpoint` enum contains the breakpoint values for different screen sizes. These are used to adjust the styling of the `EntryListFiltersBox` component based on the screen size.
