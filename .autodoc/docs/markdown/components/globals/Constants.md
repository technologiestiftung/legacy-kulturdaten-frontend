The code defines a set of CSS variables and utility functions for use in the kulturdaten-frontend project. The CSS variables define a range of colors, font sizes, line heights, and other properties that can be used throughout the project to ensure consistency in the visual design. The utility functions include a media query function (`mq`) that generates a CSS media query based on a given breakpoint, a grid layout function (`contentGrid`) that generates a CSS grid layout with a specified number of columns, and two functions (`insetBorder` and `insetBorderColored`) that generate CSS box-shadow properties to create an inset border effect on one or more sides of an element.

The `CSSVars` component exports the CSS variables as a global style using the `@emotion/react` library. This component can be included in the root of the application to ensure that the variables are available throughout the project.

The `mq` function takes a `Breakpoint` enum value (defined in the `WindowService` module) and returns a CSS media query string that targets screens with a minimum width equal to the breakpoint's value. This function can be used to apply styles only to screens above a certain size, ensuring that the layout and design of the application are optimized for different screen sizes.

The `contentGrid` function generates a CSS grid layout with a specified number of columns. This function can be used to create consistent grid layouts throughout the project, ensuring that elements are aligned and spaced correctly.

The `insetBorder` and `insetBorderColored` functions generate CSS box-shadow properties to create an inset border effect on one or more sides of an element. These functions can be used to add borders to elements without affecting their layout or positioning, and can be customized with different colors and border styles.

The `overlayStyles`, `focusStyles`, and `focusBlackStyles` variables define CSS styles for use in specific contexts. `overlayStyles` defines a black background with a semi-transparent overlay, `focusStyles` defines a blue outline to indicate focus on an element, and `focusBlackStyles` defines a black outline with a white border to indicate focus on a dark element.

Overall, this code provides a set of reusable CSS variables and utility functions that can be used throughout the kulturdaten-frontend project to ensure consistency in the visual design and layout of the application.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CSSVars` component?
   - The `CSSVars` component defines CSS variables for various colors, font sizes, and other styles to be used throughout the application.
2. What is the purpose of the `mq` function?
   - The `mq` function returns a media query string based on a given breakpoint, which can be used to apply styles only when the screen width is above a certain size.
3. What is the purpose of the `insetBorder` and `insetBorderColored` functions?
   - The `insetBorder` and `insetBorderColored` functions create CSS box-shadow values that can be used to create borders around elements, with the ability to specify which sides should have a border and what color it should be.
