The code defines a React component called `TeamList` that renders a table of team members and their roles. The component takes in an array of `OrganizerRole` objects, which represent the roles of team members in an organization. The component also takes in a boolean `userIsOwner` that indicates whether the current user is the owner of the organization.

The `TeamList` component renders a scrollable table with columns for email, role, and remove button. The email column displays the email address of each team member, and the role column displays a dropdown menu that allows the owner to change the role of each team member. The remove button allows the owner to remove team members from the organization.

The `TeamList` component uses several styled components to define the layout and styling of the table. The `StyledTeamList` component defines a flexbox container for the table, while the `StyledTeamListScrollBox` component defines a scrollable container for the table. The `StyledTeamListList` component defines the table itself, and the `StyledTeamListItem` component defines the rows of the table.

The `TeamList` component also uses several utility functions and components from the `lib` and `globals` directories. The `useT` hook provides translations for the component, while the `usePseudoUID` hook generates unique IDs for the component's elements. The `useUser` hook provides information about the current user, and the `Info` component displays informational messages to the user.

Overall, the `TeamList` component provides a way for owners of an organization to manage the roles of their team members. The component is used in the larger `kulturdaten-frontend` project to allow users to create and manage cultural events and organizations.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines styled components and a React functional component for rendering a team list with roles and email addresses.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code imports several libraries and dependencies including `@emotion/styled`, `@emotion/react`, `react`, `react-dom`, and `react-scripts`.

3. What props does the `TeamList` component accept and how are they used?
- The `TeamList` component accepts three props: `roles`, `onChange`, and `userIsOwner`. `roles` is an array of `OrganizerRole` objects that contain information about team members and their roles. `onChange` is a callback function that is called when a role is changed or removed. `userIsOwner` is a boolean value that indicates whether the current user is the owner of the team. These props are used to render the team list and allow the user to modify roles.
