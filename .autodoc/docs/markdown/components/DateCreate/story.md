This code defines a Storybook story for the `DateCreate` component and exports it as a default export. The `DateCreate` component is imported from the current directory's `index.ts` file, and the `Language` enum is imported from the `config/locale` directory. 

The `StoryWrapper` constant is defined using the `styled` function from the `@emotion/styled` package. It sets some CSS styles for a div element that wraps the `DateCreate` component in the story. The `DateCreateDefaultStory` constant is defined as a function that returns a JSX element. It renders the `DateCreate` component with some props, including an `onSubmit` function that does nothing and an object that maps language codes to offer titles. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a visual representation of the `DateCreate` component in Storybook, a tool for developing and testing UI components in isolation. The `DateCreate` component is likely a form for creating a new date or event, and the `DateCreateDefaultStory` function renders it with some default props to show how it looks and behaves. Developers can use this story to test the component's functionality and appearance without having to navigate to the actual page where it is used in the larger project. 

Here is an example of how the `DateCreate` component might be used in the larger project:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { DateCreate } from './components';

function CreateDatePage() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({});

  function handleSubmit() {
    // send formData to server
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Create a New Date</h1>
      <DateCreate onSubmit={handleSubmit} offerTitles={{ de: 'Angebot', en: 'Offer' }} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `CreateDatePage` component renders the `DateCreate` component with an `onSubmit` function that sends the form data to the server when the user submits the form. The `offerTitles` prop is passed as an object that maps the German and English language codes to the corresponding offer titles.
