The code defines a React component called `DownloadToast` that renders a toast notification for a file download. The toast notification is displayed at the bottom of the screen and includes a progress bar, an icon, and text indicating the status of the download. The component takes in several props, including the name of the file being downloaded, the progress of the download, and an optional error message.

The `DownloadToast` component is styled using the `styled` function from the `@emotion/styled` library and the `css` function from the `@emotion/react` library. The styles define the position, size, and appearance of the toast notification, as well as the animation that is used to fade the notification in and out.

The `DownloadToast` component also uses the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks from React to manage the animation state of the toast notification. When the `fadeOut` prop is set to `true`, the component sets the animation status to "paused" and then uses a `setTimeout` function to set the animation status to "fadeOut" after a short delay. This causes the toast notification to fade out of view.

The `DownloadToast` component is used in other parts of the `kulturdaten-frontend` project to display notifications when files are downloaded. For example, the component is used in the `DownloadButton` component to display a toast notification when a user clicks the download button. The `DownloadToast` component can also be used in other parts of the project to display notifications for other types of events.
