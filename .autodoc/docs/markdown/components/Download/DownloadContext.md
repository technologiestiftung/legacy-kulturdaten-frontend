[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/technologiestiftung/kulturdaten-frontend/blob/master/components/Download/DownloadContext.tsx)

The code defines a React context and provider for managing downloads in the Kulturdaten Frontend project. The context provides access to an array of downloads, as well as methods for adding, updating, and removing downloads. 

The downloads are represented as objects with an ID, file name, progress, and optional fadeOut and error properties. The reducer function handles the state updates for the downloads array based on actions dispatched to it. The actions are defined as an enum with values for adding, updating, and removing downloads. 

The DownloadContextProvider component is the context provider that wraps its children with the DownloadContext. It uses the useReducer hook to manage the downloads state and the useState hook to keep track of the next available ID for new downloads. The provider value includes the downloads array, as well as the add, update, remove, and getNewId methods. 

The DownloadToastWrapper and DownloadToast components are not defined in this file, but are imported from other files in the project. The DownloadToastWrapper component is a simple wrapper that positions the DownloadToast components on the screen. The DownloadToast component is a visual representation of a download, displaying the file name, progress, and any errors. 

Overall, this code provides a centralized way to manage downloads in the Kulturdaten Frontend project. Other components can access the downloads array and methods through the DownloadContext, and the DownloadToast components provide a visual representation of the downloads in progress.
