This code defines a story for a Textarea component using the Storybook library. The Textarea component is imported from another file in the same directory. The purpose of this code is to provide a visual representation of the Textarea component and its default behavior.

The code defines a styled wrapper component and a styled cell component using the Emotion library. The wrapper component is used to display the Textarea component in a grid layout with two columns. The cell component is used to define the width of the Textarea component.

The TextareaDefaultStory function is defined as a Storybook story with the title "Textarea". It uses the useState hook to define a state variable called "value" with an initial value of an empty string. The Textarea component is then rendered inside the StyledCell component with various props such as id, rows, value, onChange, placeholder, and label. The value of the Textarea component is set to the "value" state variable and the onChange function updates the "value" state variable with the new value entered by the user.

This code can be used to test and showcase the Textarea component in isolation from the rest of the project. It allows developers to see how the component looks and behaves with different props and values. It also provides a way to document the component's usage and expected behavior for other developers who may be working on the project. 

Example usage of the TextareaDefaultStory component in a Storybook story:

```jsx
import { TextareaDefaultStory } from './Textarea.stories';

export default {
  title: 'Form',
};

export const TextareaStory = () => <TextareaDefaultStory />;
```
