The code above is a Storybook story for the `Info` component. Storybook is a tool for developing UI components in isolation, allowing developers to view and interact with components in different states and configurations. The `Info` component is likely a reusable component that displays information to the user.

The `import` statement at the top of the file imports the `Story` component from the `@storybook/react` package and the `Info` component from a local file. The `export default` statement exports an object that defines the title of the story as "Info". The `export const` statement exports a `Story` component that renders the `Info` component with some sample text.

This code is useful for developers who are working on the `Info` component or any component that uses the `Info` component. By using Storybook, developers can quickly see how the `Info` component looks and behaves in different scenarios without having to navigate to different parts of the application. This can save time and make it easier to identify and fix issues with the component.

Here is an example of how the `Info` component might be used in a larger project:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Info from './Info';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to MyComponent</h1>
      <Info>
        This is some information about MyComponent. It can be used to display important details or instructions to the user.
      </Info>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, the `Info` component is used to display information about the `MyComponent` component. This could be used to provide instructions to the user or to explain the purpose of the component. By using the `Info` component, the developer can ensure that the information is displayed consistently and with a consistent style throughout the application.
