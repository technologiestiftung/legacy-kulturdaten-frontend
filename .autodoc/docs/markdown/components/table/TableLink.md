The code defines a styled component called `TableLink` that renders a link with a table-like appearance. The link can be either active or inactive, and can be forbidden (i.e. disabled). The component takes in several props, including `children` (the content of the link), `href` (the URL the link should navigate to), `isActive` (a boolean indicating whether the link is currently active), `onClick` (a function to be called when the link is clicked), and `forbidden` (a boolean indicating whether the link is forbidden).

The `TableLink` component is composed of two styled components: `StyledTableLink` and `StyledTableLinkText`. `StyledTableLink` is the outermost component and renders the link itself. It has several CSS properties, including a `box-shadow` that creates an inset border on the bottom of the link. If the link is active, it also adds a vertical line to the left of the link and underlines the link text. If the link is forbidden, it reduces the opacity of the link and changes the cursor to `not-allowed`.

`StyledTableLinkText` is a child component of `StyledTableLink` and is responsible for rendering the link text. If the link is active, it underlines the text.

The `TableLink` component conditionally renders a `Link` component from the `next/link` library if a `href` prop is provided. This allows the link to be server-side rendered and improves performance. If no `href` prop is provided, it simply renders the `StyledTableLink` component.

Overall, this code provides a reusable component for rendering links in a table-like format with various states (active, inactive, forbidden). It can be used throughout the project wherever such links are needed. An example usage of the `TableLink` component might look like this:

```
<TableLink href="/about" isActive={true}>About Us</TableLink>
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TableLink` component?
- The `TableLink` component is a React functional component that renders a link with customizable properties such as `href`, `isActive`, `onClick`, and `forbidden`.

2. What is the significance of the `StyledTableLink` and `StyledTableLinkText` styled components?
- The `StyledTableLink` and `StyledTableLinkText` styled components define the styles for the link and its text respectively, including hover effects, underlining, and box shadow.

3. What is the purpose of the `insetBorder` function imported from `../globals/Constants`?
- The `insetBorder` function is used to generate a CSS box shadow property with customizable parameters for top, right, bottom, and left borders. In this code, it is used to create a bottom border for the link.
