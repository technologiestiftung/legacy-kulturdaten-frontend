The code defines two React components, `InternalMenuLink` and `MenuLink`, which are used to render links in the application's navigation menu. 

`InternalMenuLink` is used for internal links within the application, and takes in `title` and `href` props to specify the link's text and destination. It also uses the `useIsRouteStringActive` hook from the `routing` module to determine if the link should be styled as active based on the current route. If the link is active, it is underlined and has a grey background. Otherwise, it has no underline and a white background. The link also includes a `File` icon from the `react-feather` library.

`MenuLink` is a higher-level component that can render both internal and external links. It takes in the same `title` and `href` props as `InternalMenuLink`, as well as an optional `type` prop that specifies whether the link is internal or external. If the `type` prop is not provided, it defaults to `MenuLinkType.internal`. If the `type` prop is `MenuLinkType.internal`, `MenuLink` renders an `InternalMenuLink` component with the provided props. If the `type` prop is `MenuLinkType.external`, `MenuLink` renders a simple anchor tag with the provided `title` and `href` props, and adds the `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and `target="_blank"` attributes to open the link in a new tab and prevent security vulnerabilities.

These components are used throughout the application to render links in the navigation menu. For example, a developer might use `InternalMenuLink` to render a link to the user's profile page within the application, and use `MenuLink` to render a link to an external website. The components provide consistent styling and behavior for all links in the menu, and make it easy to switch between internal and external links as needed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useIsRouteStringActive` function imported from `../../../lib/routing`?
- The `useIsRouteStringActive` function is used to determine if the current route matches the provided `href` string.

2. What is the purpose of the `MenuLinkType` enum?
- The `MenuLinkType` enum is used to specify the type of link, either internal or external.

3. What is the purpose of the `MenuLink` component?
- The `MenuLink` component is a reusable component that can render either an internal or external link based on the `type` prop passed to it. It uses the `InternalMenuLink` component for internal links and a styled anchor tag for external links.
