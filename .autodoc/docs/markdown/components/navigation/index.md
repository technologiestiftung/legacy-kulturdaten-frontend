The code is a collection of React hooks and components that provide navigation functionality for the Kulturdaten-frontend project. The main purpose of this code is to provide a navigation menu and header for the application. The code is divided into two main parts: the `NavigationProps` interface and the `useNavigation` hook.

The `NavigationProps` interface defines the structure of the navigation menu. It takes an array of `menus`, each of which contains a `key`, a `menu` component, a `title`, and an optional `expandable` flag. The `defaultMenuKey` property specifies the default menu to display. The `title` property specifies the title of the navigation menu. The `Link` property is a React component that is used to render links in the header. The `subMenuKey` property is an optional key that specifies the sub-menu to display.

The `useNavigation` hook takes a `NavigationStructure` object, a `title` string, a `Link` component, and a `Layouts` object. It returns an object with two properties: `header` and `sidebar`. The `header` property contains two React elements: `main` and `secondary`. The `sidebar` property contains a React element that represents the current menu.

The `useNavigation` hook uses several other hooks to provide navigation functionality. The `useBreakpointOrWider` hook is used to determine the current breakpoint of the application. The `useCategory` hook is used to get the current category of the application. The `useUser` hook is used to get the current user of the application. The `useLocale` hook is used to get the current locale of the application. The `useRouter` hook is used to get the current router of the application. The `useLanguage` hook is used to get the current language of the application. The `useActiveRoute` hook is used to get the current active route of the application. The `useOrganizerId` hook is used to get the current organizer ID of the application. The `useOrganizer` hook is used to get the current organizer of the application.

The `useNavigationOverlayVisible` hook is used to determine whether the navigation overlay is visible or not. It uses the `NavigationContext` to get the current state of the navigation menu and the `useBreakpointOrWider` hook to determine the current breakpoint of the application.

Overall, this code provides a flexible and extensible navigation system for the Kulturdaten-frontend project. It allows for the creation of custom menus and headers and provides hooks for accessing and manipulating the current state of the application.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useNavigation` hook?
- The `useNavigation` hook is used to generate the header and sidebar navigation components based on the provided structure, title, link, and layout.

2. What is the `NavigationProps` interface used for?
- The `NavigationProps` interface is used to define the props that are passed to the `useNavigation` hook, including the menus, default menu key, title, link, and sub-menu key.

3. What is the `useNavigationOverlayVisible` hook used for?
- The `useNavigationOverlayVisible` hook is used to determine whether the navigation overlay should be visible based on the current state of the menu expansion and the screen size.
