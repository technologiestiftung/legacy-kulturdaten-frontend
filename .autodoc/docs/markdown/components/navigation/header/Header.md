The code defines two React components, `HeaderMain` and `HeaderSecondary`, which are used to render the main and secondary headers of the website respectively. The components use various other components and hooks to render the header elements, such as the `HeaderMenuLink`, `LocaleSwitch`, `UserMenu`, and `OrganizerBand` components. 

The `HeaderMain` component takes in several props, including the title of the page, an optional custom link, an array of menu items, and a `WrappedUser` object representing the current user. It renders the main header of the website, which includes the site title, a menu bar with links to various pages, and a user menu. The `HeaderSecondary` component is similar, but is used for pages with a different layout and may include an `OrganizerBand` component instead of a site title.

The `HeaderMain` component uses the `useBreakpointOrWider` hook to determine whether the screen width is at least `Breakpoint.mid`, and renders the header accordingly. If the screen is wide enough, the site title is displayed on the left side of the header, along with the menu bar and user menu on the right. If the screen is too narrow, only the menu bar is displayed. The `HeaderSecondary` component is always displayed in the same way, with the site title or `OrganizerBand` on the left and the user menu on the right.

The `HeaderMain` component also uses the `useActiveRoute` and `useT` hooks to determine the current active route and translate the display name of the route. It also uses the `useOrganizer` hook to retrieve information about the current organizer, and the `useLanguage` hook to determine the current language of the website. The `HeaderOrganizerMenu` component is used to display the organizer name and logo in the header, and can be collapsed or expanded by the user.

Overall, these components are used to render the header of the website, including the site title, menu bar, user menu, and organizer logo. They are used in conjunction with other components and hooks to provide a responsive and customizable header for the website.
