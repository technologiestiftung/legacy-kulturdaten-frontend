The `UserMenu` component is a dropdown menu that displays user-related options such as user settings, admin mode, and logout. It is part of the larger `kulturdaten-frontend` project and is used in the header of the application.

The component imports various hooks and components from the project's codebase, including `useT` for translations, `useLocale` for getting the current locale, `useAdminMode` for checking if the user is in admin mode, and `useUser` for getting user information and handling logout. It also imports the `HeaderMenuLink` component for rendering links in the dropdown menu, and the `Button` and `DropdownMenu` components for styling.

The `UserMenu` component takes in a `WrappedUser` object as a prop, which contains information about the logged-in user. It then uses the imported hooks to get the necessary information and render the dropdown menu. The menu displays the user's email address, and if the user is a superuser, it also displays a link to the admin page. The user can also access their settings page and log out of the application.

The component uses the `useMemo` hook to determine if the current layout has an organizer band, which affects the styling of the dropdown menu button. It also uses the `useBreakpointOrWider` hook to determine if the screen size is mid-sized or wider, which affects the button color.

Overall, the `UserMenu` component provides a convenient way for users to access their account information and perform user-related actions in the application.
