The code above defines a React functional component called `ComponentLoader`. This component is responsible for rendering a loading spinner with a text message indicating that the application is currently loading. 

The loading spinner is defined in the `StyledLoadingScreenWobbler` component, which is imported from the `../Loading/LoadingScreen` module. This component is styled using the `StyledLoader` and `StyledLoaderInner` styled components, which define the layout and positioning of the spinner and text message. 

The `StyledLoader` component defines the outer container for the loading spinner and sets its width, height, padding, background color, and border radius. The `StyledLoaderInner` component defines the inner container for the spinner and text message and sets its position, width, height, and alignment properties. The `StyledLoaderInnerText` component sets the font size, line height, position, and color of the text message. 

The `useT` hook is imported from the `../../lib/i18n` module and is used to translate the text message into the user's preferred language. The translated text is passed to the `StyledLoaderInnerText` component as a prop. 

This component can be used throughout the application to indicate that a particular component or page is currently loading. It provides a consistent and visually appealing loading experience for the user. 

Example usage:

```
import { ComponentLoader } from './ComponentLoader';

const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // simulate loading data
    setTimeout(() => {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }, 2000);
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      {isLoading ? (
        <ComponentLoader />
      ) : (
        <div>Loaded content goes here</div>
      )}
    </>
  );
};
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a React component called `ComponentLoader` that displays a loading screen with a wobbler animation and a loading text.

2. What is the role of the `useT` hook?
   - The `useT` hook is used to access the translation function provided by the `i18n` library, which is used to translate the loading text displayed by the component.

3. What is the purpose of the `StyledLoader` and `StyledLoaderInner` components?
   - The `StyledLoader` component defines the outer container of the loading screen, while the `StyledLoaderInner` component defines the inner container that holds the wobbler animation and loading text.
