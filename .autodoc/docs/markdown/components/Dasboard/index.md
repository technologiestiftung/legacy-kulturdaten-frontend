The code above defines two styled components and two React components that are used in the Kulturdaten Frontend project. The purpose of this code is to provide consistent styling for the dashboard greeting and wrapper components across different screen sizes.

The first styled component, `StyledDashboardGreeting`, is a container for the dashboard greeting text. It is a flex container with a column direction and a row gap of 0.75rem. It also has different padding values depending on the screen size, which are defined using the `mq` function from the `Constants` module. The `mq` function takes a breakpoint value and returns a CSS media query string that targets screens larger than that breakpoint. The `Breakpoint` enum defines the different breakpoint values used in the project.

The second styled component, `StyledDashboardGreetingHeadline`, is a styled `h1` element that defines the styling for the dashboard greeting headline text. It has a font size, line height, and font weight that are defined using CSS variables.

The third styled component, `StyledDashboardGreetingSubline`, is a styled `p` element that defines the styling for the dashboard greeting subline text. It has a font size, line height, and font weight that are also defined using CSS variables.

The first React component, `DashboardGreeting`, is a functional component that takes two props: `children` and `subline`. The `children` prop is used as the text for the dashboard greeting headline, while the `subline` prop is used as the text for the dashboard greeting subline. If the `subline` prop is not provided, the `StyledDashboardGreetingSubline` component is not rendered.

The second React component, `DashboardWrapper`, is a styled `div` element that provides consistent padding for the dashboard content. Like the `StyledDashboardGreeting` component, it has different padding values depending on the screen size.

Overall, this code provides a reusable and responsive styling solution for the dashboard greeting and wrapper components in the Kulturdaten Frontend project. It allows for consistent styling across different screen sizes and provides a clear separation of concerns between the styling and functionality of these components.
