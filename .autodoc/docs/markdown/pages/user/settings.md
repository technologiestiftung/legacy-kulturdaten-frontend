The code above is a Next.js page component that renders the user settings page of the Kulturdaten Frontend application. The page is composed of two main components: the `AppWrapper` and the `UserSettingsPage`.

The `AppWrapper` component is a higher-order component that wraps the entire application and provides common functionality such as authentication, navigation, and error handling. It is imported from the `../../components/wrappers/AppWrapper` module.

The `UserSettingsPage` component is a custom component that contains the user settings form and logic. It is imported from the `../../components/pages/user/settings` module.

The `SettingsPage` component is a functional component that returns the `AppWrapper` component with the `UserSettingsPage` component as its child. It is exported as the default export of the module.

This code is used in the larger Kulturdaten Frontend project to render the user settings page. It is likely that this page is accessible only to authenticated users, and that the `AppWrapper` component handles the authentication logic. The `UserSettingsPage` component is responsible for rendering the user settings form and handling user input.

Here is an example of how this component might be used in a Next.js application:

```jsx
import SettingsPage from '../pages/user/settings';

const UserSettings = () => {
  return <SettingsPage />;
};

export default UserSettings;
```

In this example, the `SettingsPage` component is imported and rendered as a child of a custom `UserSettings` component. This component can be used to define any additional logic or functionality specific to the user settings page.
## Questions:
