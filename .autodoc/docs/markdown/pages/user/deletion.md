The code above is a Next.js page component that renders a user deletion page. It imports the `NextPage` component from the `next` package, which is used to define a Next.js page. It also imports the `UserDeletionPage` component from the `../../components/pages/user/deletion` file, which is the actual content of the page. Additionally, it imports the `AppWrapper` component from the `../../components/wrappers/AppWrapper` file, which is a higher-order component that wraps the `UserDeletionPage` component and provides some common functionality, such as a header and footer.

The `DeletionPage` component is defined as a function that returns a JSX element. It uses the `AppWrapper` component to wrap the `UserDeletionPage` component, which is rendered inside it. The purpose of this component is to provide a consistent layout and styling for the user deletion page, as well as any other pages that use the `AppWrapper` component.

This code is part of the larger `kulturdaten-frontend` project, which is a web application for cultural data management. The `DeletionPage` component is just one of many pages in the application, and it is used to allow users to delete their accounts. By using the `AppWrapper` component, the page has a consistent look and feel with the rest of the application, which improves the user experience.

Here is an example of how this component might be used in the larger project:

```
import DeletionPage from '../pages/user/deletion';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <header>...</header>
      <main>
        <DeletionPage />
      </main>
      <footer>...</footer>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, the `DeletionPage` component is imported and rendered inside the `App` component, which is the main entry point for the application. The `App` component provides a header and footer, and the `DeletionPage` component is wrapped in the `AppWrapper` component, which provides additional layout and styling.
