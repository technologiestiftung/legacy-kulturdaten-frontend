The code above is a Next.js page component that renders a notifications page for the Kulturdaten Frontend project. The page is wrapped in an `AppWrapper` component that provides a consistent layout and styling across all pages of the application. 

The `NextPage` type is imported from the Next.js library and is used to define the type of the component. It indicates that this component is a Next.js page component, which means it can be rendered on both the server and the client side. 

The `NotificationsPage` component is a functional component that returns JSX. The JSX code is wrapped in the `AppWrapper` component, which is imported from the `../../components/wrappers/AppWrapper` file. The `AppWrapper` component is responsible for rendering the header, footer, and other common elements of the application. 

The `NotificationsPage` component currently displays "TBD" (To Be Determined) as a placeholder for the actual content that will be displayed on the notifications page. This component can be modified to display actual notifications data by fetching data from an API or a database. 

This component is just one of many page components in the Kulturdaten Frontend project. Each page component is responsible for rendering a specific page of the application. The `AppWrapper` component is used to provide a consistent layout and styling across all pages of the application. 

Here is an example of how this component can be used in the larger project:

```jsx
import NotificationsPage from '../pages/notifications';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <header>Header</header>
      <main>
        <NotificationsPage />
      </main>
      <footer>Footer</footer>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In the example above, the `NotificationsPage` component is imported and rendered inside the `main` element of the `App` component. The `AppWrapper` component is automatically included in the `NotificationsPage` component, providing a consistent layout and styling across all pages of the application.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NextPage` import?
   - The `NextPage` import is used to define the type of the `NotificationsPage` component as a Next.js page component.

2. What is the `AppWrapper` component used for?
   - The `AppWrapper` component is a custom wrapper component that is used to provide a consistent layout and styling for the application.

3. What does the `TBD` placeholder represent in the `NotificationsPage` component?
   - The `TBD` placeholder represents content that is "To Be Determined" and will be replaced with actual content in a future update to the application.
