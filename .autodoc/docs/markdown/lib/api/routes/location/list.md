[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/technologiestiftung/kulturdaten-frontend/blob/master/lib/api/routes/location/list.ts)

The code defines an API call to retrieve a list of locations from a server. It exports an interface `LocationList` that extends `ApiCall`, which defines the structure of the request and response of the API call. The request has a `route` property that is a function call to `apiRoutes.locationList(query)`, which generates the URL for the API endpoint with the given query parameters. The request also has a `method` property set to `'GET'` and an `Authorization` header with a bearer token generated from the `makeBearer` function. The response has a `status` property set to `200` and a `body` property that is an array of `Location` objects.

The code also exports a function `locationListFactory` that takes a bearer token and query parameters as arguments and returns an instance of `LocationList`. This function is a factory function that generates instances of `LocationList` with the given parameters. This allows for easy creation of API calls with different query parameters and bearer tokens.

This code is part of a larger project that likely includes other API calls and components that use these API calls to retrieve and display data. The `LocationList` interface and `locationListFactory` function can be used by other components to retrieve a list of locations from the server and display them to the user. For example, a component that displays a map of locations could use this API call to retrieve the list of locations and display them on the map. The `locationListFactory` function can be called with different query parameters to retrieve different subsets of the location data, such as locations within a certain radius or locations with a certain type of event.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines an interface and a factory function for making API calls to retrieve a list of locations.

2. What dependencies are being imported?
   The code imports `ParsedUrlQuery` from the built-in `node:querystring` module, as well as several functions and types from other modules within the project.

3. What is the expected format of the API response?
   The API response is expected to have a status code of 200 and a body containing an object with a `data` property, which is an array of `Location` objects.
