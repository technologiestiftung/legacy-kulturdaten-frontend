[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/technologiestiftung/kulturdaten-frontend/blob/master/lib/api/routes/location/update.ts)

The code defines a type and a factory function for making API calls to update a location in the kulturdaten-frontend project. The `LocationUpdate` type extends the `ApiCall` type and specifies the request and response formats for the API call. The request includes the route, method, headers (including an authorization token and content type), and body (the updated location data). The response includes a status code of 200 and a body with the updated location data and a success message.

The `locationUpdateFactory` function takes an authorization token and a query object with an ID and updated location data as arguments, and returns an object that conforms to the `LocationUpdate` type. The returned object includes the request and response formats for the API call, with the authorization token and query data passed in as arguments.

This code can be used to update a location in the kulturdaten-frontend project by making an API call to the `/auth/info` endpoint with a PATCH method and the updated location data in the request body. The `locationUpdateFactory` function provides a convenient way to generate the necessary request and response formats for this API call, with the authorization token and query data passed in as arguments. This code is likely used in conjunction with other code in the project to provide a user interface for updating location data.
