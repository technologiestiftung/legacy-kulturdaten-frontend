The code defines an interface and a factory function for making API calls to delete an app token. The app token is a type defined elsewhere in the project. 

The interface, `AppTokenDelete`, extends `ApiCall` and defines the request and response types for the API call. The request type includes the route, method, headers, and body of the API call. The response type includes the expected status code and body of the response.

The factory function, `appTokenDeleteFactory`, takes a token and a query object as arguments and returns an object that conforms to the `AppTokenDelete` interface. The token is used to authenticate the API call, and the query object includes the ID of the app token to be deleted and the app token itself. The factory function constructs the request object by calling the `apiRoutes.appToken` function with the ID of the app token, setting the method to 'DELETE', setting the headers to include the token and the content type, and setting the body to the app token from the query object. The response object is left undefined, as it is not needed for this API call.

This code can be used in the larger project to delete an app token from the server. The `AppTokenDelete` interface and `appTokenDeleteFactory` function provide a standardized way to make this API call, which can be used throughout the project. Other parts of the project can import these functions and interfaces to interact with the app token API. For example, a user interface component might use `appTokenDeleteFactory` to delete an app token when the user clicks a button.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AppTokenDelete` interface?
   - The `AppTokenDelete` interface defines the structure of an API call to delete an app token.
2. What is the `appTokenDeleteFactory` function used for?
   - The `appTokenDeleteFactory` function is a factory function that creates an instance of the `AppTokenDelete` interface with the provided token and query parameters.
3. What is the purpose of the `makeBearer` function?
   - The `makeBearer` function is used to create an authorization header value with the provided token.
