[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/technologiestiftung/kulturdaten-frontend/blob/master/lib/api/routes/offer/date/list.ts)

This code defines an interface and a factory function for making API calls to retrieve a list of offer dates. The interface, `OfferDateList`, extends the `ApiCall` interface and specifies the request and response types for the API call. The request type includes the route, method, and authorization header, while the response type includes the expected status code and response body.

The factory function, `offerDateListFactory`, takes a token and a query object as arguments and returns an object that conforms to the `OfferDateList` interface. The query object must include an `offerId` property, which is used to construct the API route. The token is used to generate the authorization header for the request.

This code is part of a larger project for a cultural data frontend, and is likely used to retrieve a list of dates for a particular cultural offer. The `OfferDate` type is likely defined elsewhere in the project and includes information about a specific date for a cultural offer. The `Language` type is also likely defined elsewhere in the project and specifies the language of the response data.

Here is an example usage of the `offerDateListFactory` function:

```
import { offerDateListFactory } from './path/to/offerDateListFactory';

const token = 'my-auth-token';
const query = { offerId: '123' };

const offerDateList = offerDateListFactory(token, query);

// Make the API call
fetch(offerDateList.request.route, {
  method: offerDateList.request.method,
  headers: offerDateList.request.headers,
})
  .then(response => {
    if (response.status === offerDateList.response.status) {
      return response.json();
    } else {
      throw new Error('API call failed');
    }
  })
  .then(data => {
    // Do something with the response data
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle errors
  });
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an interface and a factory function for making API calls to retrieve a list of offer dates.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several modules from parent and sibling directories, including `node:querystring`, `../../..`, and `../../types/offer`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `offerDateListFactory` function?
- The `offerDateListFactory` function takes a token and a query object as input and returns an object conforming to the `OfferDateList` interface, which includes a request object with route, method, and headers properties, and a response object with status and body properties.
