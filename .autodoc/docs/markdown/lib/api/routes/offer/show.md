[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/technologiestiftung/kulturdaten-frontend/blob/master/lib/api/routes/offer/show.ts)

The code defines an interface and a factory function related to making API calls to retrieve information about a cultural offer. The `OfferShow` interface extends the `ApiCall` interface, which defines the structure of an API call. The `OfferShow` interface specifies that the API call should use the HTTP GET method and include an authorization header. The response is expected to have a status code of 200 and a body containing an object of type `Offer`.

The `offerShowFactory` function takes two arguments: a token for authorization and a query object containing an `id` property. The function returns an object that conforms to the `OfferShow` interface. The `request` property of the returned object specifies the API route to use, the HTTP method, and the authorization header. The `response` property specifies the expected status code and the shape of the response body.

This code is likely used in the larger project to make API calls to retrieve information about cultural offers. The `offerShowFactory` function can be called with a token and an offer ID to create an object that can be used to make the API call. The response from the API call can then be checked against the `OfferShow` interface to ensure that it has the expected structure.

Example usage:

```
const token = 'my-auth-token';
const offerId = '123';

const offerShow = offerShowFactory(token, { id: offerId });

// Make API call using offerShow.request

// Check response against offerShow.response
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Offer` type imported at the beginning of the code?
- The `Offer` type is used in the `OfferShow` interface to define the structure of the `data` property in the response body.

2. What is the `offerShowFactory` function used for?
- The `offerShowFactory` function creates an object that conforms to the `OfferShow` interface, with the provided `token` and `query` parameters used to construct the request.

3. What is the expected HTTP status code and response body structure for the `OfferShow` API call?
- The `OfferShow` API call is expected to return a `200` status code and a response body with a `data` property containing an `Offer` object.
