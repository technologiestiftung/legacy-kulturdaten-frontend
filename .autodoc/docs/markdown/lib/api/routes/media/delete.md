[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/technologiestiftung/kulturdaten-frontend/blob/master/lib/api/routes/media/delete.ts)

The code defines an interface and a factory function for making API calls to delete media from a server. The interface, `MediaDelete`, extends the `ApiCall` interface and specifies the request and response types for the API call. The request type includes the route, method, headers, and body of the API call, while the response type includes the expected status code and response body.

The factory function, `mediaDeleteFactory`, takes a token and a query object as arguments and returns an object that conforms to the `MediaDelete` interface. The token is used to authenticate the API call, while the query object specifies the ID of the media to be deleted and its data. The factory function constructs the request object by calling the `apiRoutes.mediaDelete` function with the ID of the media to be deleted, setting the method to 'DELETE', and setting the headers to include the token and the content type. The body of the request is set to the data of the media to be deleted, if it exists. The response object is set to expect a 200 status code and an undefined response body.

This code is part of a larger project that likely includes other API calls and functionality for managing media data. The `mediaDeleteFactory` function can be used to make API calls to delete media from the server, and can be called from other parts of the project that need to delete media. The `MediaDelete` interface provides a type-safe way to define the request and response types for the API call, which can help prevent errors and improve code readability. Overall, this code helps to provide a structured and reusable way to delete media data from the server.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MediaDelete` interface?
- The `MediaDelete` interface defines the structure of an API call for deleting media, including the request and response formats.

2. What is the `mediaDeleteFactory` function used for?
- The `mediaDeleteFactory` function creates an instance of the `MediaDelete` interface with the provided token and query parameters, which can then be used to make an API call to delete media.

3. What is the role of the `makeBearer` function?
- The `makeBearer` function is used to generate an authorization header value for the API call, using the provided token.
