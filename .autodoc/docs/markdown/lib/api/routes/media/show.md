The code defines an interface and a factory function for making API calls to retrieve information about a specific media item. The `MediaShow` interface extends the `ApiCall` interface, which defines the structure of an API call. The `MediaShow` interface specifies that the API call should use the HTTP GET method and include an authorization header with a bearer token. The response is expected to have a status code of 200 and a body containing a `Media` object.

The `mediaShowFactory` function takes a bearer token and a query object with an `id` property as arguments. It returns an object that conforms to the `MediaShow` interface. The `route` property of the `request` object is set using the `apiRoutes.mediaShow` function, which generates the URL for the media item API endpoint using the `id` from the query object. The `Authorization` header is set using the `makeBearer` function, which formats the token as a bearer token. The `response` object has a default value of `undefined` for the `body` property.

This code can be used in the larger project to make API calls to retrieve information about a specific media item. The `mediaShowFactory` function can be called with a bearer token and an `id` to generate an object that can be passed to the `fetch` function or another HTTP client to make the API call. The response can then be parsed and used to display information about the media item on the frontend.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MediaShow` interface?
   - The `MediaShow` interface defines the structure of an API call to retrieve information about a specific media item.
2. What is the `mediaShowFactory` function used for?
   - The `mediaShowFactory` function creates an instance of the `MediaShow` interface with the provided token and query parameters.
3. What is the `Authorization` header used for in this code?
   - The `Authorization` header is used to authenticate the API call with a bearer token generated from the provided token parameter.
