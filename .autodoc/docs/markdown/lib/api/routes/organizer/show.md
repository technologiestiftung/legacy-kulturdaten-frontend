[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/technologiestiftung/kulturdaten-frontend/blob/master/lib/api/routes/organizer/show.ts)

The code defines an interface and a factory function for making API calls to retrieve information about an organizer. The interface, `OrganizerShow`, extends `ApiCall` and specifies the request and response types for the API call. The request type includes the route, method, and authorization header, while the response type includes the expected status code and response body, which should contain an object of type `Organizer`.

The `organizerShowFactory` function takes in a token and a query object with an `organizer` property, and returns an object that conforms to the `OrganizerShow` interface. The returned object includes a request object with the specified route, method, and authorization header, as well as a response object with the expected status code and an undefined body.

This code is likely used in the larger project to make API calls to retrieve information about organizers. The `organizerShowFactory` function can be called with a token and an organizer ID to create an object that can be passed to a function that makes the actual API call. The response from the API call can then be used to populate the UI with information about the organizer.

Example usage:

```
const token = 'my-auth-token';
const organizerId = '123';

const organizerShow = organizerShowFactory(token, { organizer: organizerId });

makeApiCall(organizerShow).then((response) => {
  const organizer = response.body.data;
  // Use organizer data to populate UI
});
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `OrganizerShow` interface?
- The `OrganizerShow` interface defines the structure of an API call to retrieve information about an organizer.

2. What is the `organizerShowFactory` function used for?
- The `organizerShowFactory` function creates an instance of the `OrganizerShow` interface with the provided token and query parameters.

3. What other modules are imported in this file?
- This file imports `apiRoutes`, `makeBearer`, `ApiCall`, and `ApiRoute` from the parent directory, as well as the `Organizer` type from a separate file.
