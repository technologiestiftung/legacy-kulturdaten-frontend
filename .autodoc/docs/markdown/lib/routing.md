The code provided is a collection of React hooks and utility functions that are used to manage routing and localization in the kulturdaten-frontend project. 

The `useIsRouteStringActive` hook takes a route string and returns a boolean indicating whether that route is currently active. It accomplishes this by comparing the route string to the current URL path using the `useRouter` hook from Next.js. 

The `useIsRouteActive` hook takes a `Routes` enum identifier, a `Locale` object, and an optional query object and returns a boolean indicating whether the specified route is currently active. It uses the `isRouteActive` function to compare the current URL path to the specified route. 

The `useActiveRoute` hook returns the currently active route as a `Routes` enum identifier. It uses the `getActiveRoute` function to determine the active route based on the current URL path and the specified locale and query parameters. 

The `useLocale` hook returns the current locale as a `Locale` object. It uses the `useRouter` hook to access the current locale. 

The `useLanguage` hook returns the current language as a `Language` object. It uses the `useLocale` hook to access the current locale and the `localeLanguageMap` object to map the locale to a language. 

The `useSwitchLocale` hook returns a function that can be used to switch the current locale. It uses the `useRouter` and `useActiveRoute` hooks to determine the current route and then uses the `routes` object to generate a new URL path with the specified locale and query parameters. It then uses the `router.push` method to navigate to the new URL and sets a cookie to remember the user's locale preference. 

Overall, these hooks and utility functions provide a convenient way to manage routing and localization in the kulturdaten-frontend project. They can be used to determine the currently active route, switch the current locale, and more.
